This partially addresses the *cold start problem*. If there are not enough products viewed/purchased, we will use items that are usually viewed and bought together with those few viewed/purchased by user.\n","\n","An alternative (or complementary) technique is *matrix factorization*. Matrix Factorization produces a user-to-product matrix of the user's preference of each product. KNN for example could be used to identify and rank the similarity. As the dataset is huge, it might require much more resources to compute. We will use only covisitation matrix.\n","\n","How the covisitation matrix is computed here:\n","1. Items which have interaction within 1 day (24 hours) are considered a covisitation pair.\n","2. Count the number of interactions between each of such pair\n","3.

This approach requires far less steps than the reranker and if done correctly can have quite good and explanable results. Theoretically, we want to push the rule-based as far as possible before using a reranker (a black box model) to boost the score further. <br>\n","Note that this current model does not differentiate in
