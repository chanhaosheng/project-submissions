nosurf,"The more time I spend away from YouTube and other social media, the more boring I find it.","Content blockers and other restrictions have helped and continue to help me think twice before scrolling. 

Limiting what I subscribe to also helps. Especially if I stick with content that actually serves me in a more positive way.

But sometimes I get curious and I revisit old topics that at one time would suck me in for hours, waste my time, make me less productive, make me feel bad about myself, or make me extremely anxious, but now they just don’t interest me as much.

Initially, being tough with restrictions helped me to step away from things but now I am at a place where I allow myself to surf but I don’t really want to. Even Reddit is losing its appeal. 

I really don’t miss other social media apps. I allow YouTube on my iPhone but no app, only through browser, with the extension “no distractions for YouTube.” With that, if I do open it, I am greeted with a blank homepage, no shorts, no comments or distracting thumbnails on videos I do watch.

Yesterday I felt productive as I listened to music while cleaning my house. I had a few moments where I allowed myself to open up the app, but the desire to binge wasn’t there and what I did watch, I discovered it’s not something I am interested in anymore. At least not to the extent that I was. It’s a nice feeling.  

It didn’t happen overnight but it does continue to get easier.

nosurf,2020 vs 2023 me,"Damn how much I've improved is astounding. My 2020 version basically spent all day on three sites: Discord, YouTube and Twitter. (Note: I downloaded Discord and Twitter in 2020, before that I only watched YouTube and played MC, literally. Quite LITERALLY, the only thing I did on my free time was YouTube. Can't believe that. I sometimes wonder how I don't have brain damage)

I'd meet new people on Twitter, get their Discord #, talk to them. Meet even more people, new servers. Spent hours talking, and while I waited for replies I watched YouTube nonstop. Literally, the only thing I did was watching videos, anything from edutainment to gaming and whatever. I didn't even freaking played that much, and didn't watch much TV shows and such, I literally only watched YouTube. Then came the Discord VC sessions with ""friends"", where I'd just waste time chatting, browsing and playing with them. LMAO guess what, only one of them is still with me. All the others? Gone.

Then I got freaking tired of this. I quit the stupid competitive games and now only play singleplayer chill stuff. Deleted my Google account and made a new one with recommendations off. And purged my whole Discord off the people I knew, leaving only one behind and the only person that I truly can call a friend, we genuinely talk as friends. Last is Twitter which I still have, but only for art and I completely avoid the degenerate side of stuff. 

So now here I am. I'm reading more and I genuinely enjoy it. Learn all kinds of stuff because I discovered I freaking love learning new things. Got into an art hobby and actually spend hours on it daily, and discovered I like creating stuff. And besides that, I still watch some TV shows but not binge watching, and as I said, casual gaming.

I've realized that I'm NOT a gamer. I don't belong there. I don't belong in Discord. Nor in Twitch and whatever other platform. I NEVER enjoyed playing skill-based/competitive games, I literally only played them because I had nothing better to do. I don't relate myself to the word ""gamer"" anymore, call me a freaking normie because I play ""girlish"" (casual) Switch games and not the ""real"" PC games, but I don't give a shit. I just want a small dose of that gaming feel and that's it.

I still probably need to get into exercising and that stuff, but progress has been made. I went from a braindead zombie YouTube consoomer to someone that actually does stuff that benefits my freaking brain. Could've been worse, never downloaded TikTok nor watched any short format videos, but it definitely was serious.

Now, it's probably counterproductive to post this on here, but I just wanted to share my experience (more like letting out my rage with my keyboard). Most likely I'll delete reddit, I sometimes get sucked in reading news. Discord too, I literally only keep it because of that friend, maybe one day we can switch to another app. Anyways that was the rant.

So far I have not installed any social apps, everyone important to me has my number if they need to get in contact with me. 

I am allowing myself to use twitter, instagram and reddit ALL i want - but only on my laptop. For me, the slight inconvenience of the web layout for those apps on a bulky laptop seems to be less of a time sinkhole.

nosurf,Have you overcome other addictions/bad habits in the past? Why this is special than others?,"Thinking back a bit, I used to drink alcohol, quite a lot. Now I have been sober for more than 5 years or so. My only intake is yearly at Christmas or New Year, and nothing else. How I did it? I don't know exactly. I guess I saw the disadvantages of it and decided to turn to another path. I'm quite sporty and drinking alcohol didn't go hand in hand with my goals, I think that's where it comes from. On the economic side, too. When you go out with people who drink a lot, you are predisposed to spend a lot of money, just to not be perceived as boring or something... Idk.  


Now, since 4 years or so I'm trying to *overcome my internet, social media or tech addictions* (or let's call it *bad habits*), but it is difficult af. I cannot see clearly and feel first hand the disadvantages/dangers of this. Yeah, I can inform myself a lot but about tech companies business and nod my head when I read something here or in an article about addiction, digital minimalism, moderation, etc. but I can't see it for myself.

nosurf,Eight cognitive biases social media takes advantage of,"As I am building the most comprehensive resource to help people reduce wasted time on social media, I decided to compile the most common cognitive distortions around social media usage. Here are eight that you might have:

1. **Fear of missing out (FOMO)**  
*“If I am not always up-to-date on what’s happening, I might miss out on something important”*  
The thought that you might be missing out on important information, experiences, decisions… This can lead to not being able to ever silence notifications; checking your phone as the last thing before bed and the first thing when you wake up.
2. **Expectation of availability**  
*“I should always reply to messages as soon as I receive them”*  
The belief that you should always be available. You always respond to messages and emails as soon as they arrive, things that feel urgent take priority over long-term projects
3. **Catastrophizing**  
*“My mom didn’t pick up the phone. Did something bad happen to her?”*  
The tendency to jump to the worst possible conclusions. You worry about things that are unlikely to have happened.
4. **Choice-supportive bias**  
*“I spend hours on social media, therefore it must mean that I enjoy it”*  
You craft a belief to justify your actions. In the example above, you do not realize that craving something and liking something are not the same.
5. **Unfair comparison**  
*""Everyone else's life seems so much more exciting than mine. They are all taking vacations, while I am here working”*  
The comparison of your life to other people’s highlight reel. It reduces your self-esteem and makes you think that there is something wrong with you.
6. **Availability heuristic**  
*“She look so joyful in this picture. She must live a happy life”*  
The belief that the limited information you have about a person is an accurate representation of their life.
7. **Questionable cause**  
*“I go on the internet when I am tired, therefore social media must be good at restoring my energy levels”*  
In this example, the belief that social media is good for dealing with tiredness, instead of believing that resisting social media is harder when we are tired.
8. **Emotional reasoning**  
“*This post about them hanging out makes me feel lonely. If I feel lonely, it must mean that nobody wants to be around me”*  
The belief that your emotions are factual representations of the world. If you feel a certain way, then you believe that it must be true, even if there is little or no evidence.",2023-03-05 12:52:13,1678020733
nosurf,Choosing music and motivation over podcasts,"I have noticed that podcast have become very addicting to me. They never offer any real pleasure or true satisfaction, so eventually I get into a downward spiral of always trying to consume more and more. This is the last addiction I need to beat.

Podcasts make me trade my own thoughts, self-amusement and being in the moment, for endless distractions and being a useless information junkie. Eventually I even destroy my sleep by needing to hear what boring topics or political outrage porn others speak about to get the small spike of dopamine I am after. I dont ever need to listen the old/best episodes, I am always after the new one and crave to hear about the latest thing. Thats what dopamine addicts usually want.

Music, motivation videos or just self-amusing myself with internal dialogue, imagination and creativity has never been compulsive, addicting or harmful for me and they offer a real lasting happiness and evelated mood. Hearing some drunk idiots laughing about fart jokes and other stupid shit is not real happiness, doesnt even make me smile in real life. Just a digital replacement therapy for doing the real thing.

Singing, dancing and even doing silly freestyle rapping about my goals and random thoughts along the day with a good beat is way more engaging than just being the passive listener who quietly listens what others talk day after day, year after year. Occupying your mind. Some people will spend their whole life as emotionless, liveless passive consumers like me, until they hopefully stop this draining habit. If your goal is to feel aliveness and joy, the choise is very clear.

With podcasts your whole life is set around them, but they dont think about you at all. You think about them all the time, while they dont even know you exist. Welcome to the parasocial relationships.

Everytime I am going to listen JRE or something as boring, I nowadays just rather open my favorite motivation videos, Easyway audiobooks or Radio Garden app that has all the radio stations around the world and rather sing and dance with the tunes. Cultivating the mental muscles of enjoying the present moment and self-amusement actually gives you what you are after. When I make the right choise - I am always 1000x happier, feel more alive and more satisfied afterwards♡",2023-03-05 12:12:28,1678018348

nosurf,"I deleted my tiktok a few days ago. here's a list of reasons why I think it's the most toxic platform ever invented, and it's poisoning the minds of the younger generation.","When I first installed the app, I quite liked the content for the first few weeks. I thought it was actually funny, light hearted and mostly harmless. Then I got on the wrong algorithm, finally got off that one, then got stuck in like, 3 more toxic algorithms that seemed so hard to get out of. Finally deleted it after a year and not looking back. Here's why I think it's the worst social media platform ever invented. 

1. The top content creators (that always seem to pop up the most) are all rich people, who's content is always ""a day in the life"" or something similar. They purposely flaunt all their expensive possessions, like makeup brands, jewelry/watches, clothes, and always have to have this certain aesthetic or allusion of perfection. No hate to rich people who have worked hard to get where they are. however how has this become so normalized to basically boast about how rich you are? When do we draw the line between someone just showing us how they live, to pure narcissism? Is this really what younger people should aspire to? Rich momtok is also the worst. There is a lot of daycare hate, praise of SAHMS (stay at home moms) and looking down on working moms - yet they don't seem to realise you need MONEY to be able to stay at home after having a kid. They are completely tone deaf.

2.this is one we probably already know so I'll just keep it brief. It further encourages screen addiction and short attention spans because of the format. it's basically just a series of short clips that keeps giving you that dopamine hit, like a slot machine. Even after only using it for a few weeks I noticed my focus and attention span was significantly worse. I can only imagine what it's doing to younger people who's brains haven't developed yet. 

3. I have noticed the toxic behavior in younger women on the app. They preach about being more feminine (which there is nothing wrong with). however they talk about ""supporting all women,"" yet they seem look down on women who don't look feminine or have girly interests. If you don't wear makeup, or if you love sports or have ANY male friends you're automatically labeled a ""pick me."" 

3.it encourages bullying more than any other app, even Twitter in my opinion (which is really saying something). This is mostly done through the stitching function which allows people to straight up mock and abuse others. But also through creators just mentioning drama without including too much info so people are prompted to look this person up. Example: when a recent top creator became manic and started putting up 100 tiktoks a day of herself, and  putting her safety at risk. I would come across tiktoks being like ""omg *insert name* is making herself look like such an idiot right now! She's clearly pretending!"" Or ""I don't believe what's going on with *insert name* right now, she's gone wild."" So of course it just brings more traffic to this person's account, which results in more attention, more hate and more bullies to come out of the woodwork. 

4. The trauma algorithm. Sometimes it is just people genuinely sharing their stories to make others feel less alone which is ok. However there is so much misinformation on that algorithm. I got so sick of seeing things like ""if you walk this certain way, or do/say things this way, it means you have childhood trauma."" Like no it doesn't. There is a wide range of reasons someone may act/do things a certain way and they're not all related to something bad happening as a child. Also Sometimes the supposed trauma was so ridiculous, like ""my mom yelled at me because I didn't clean my room once, and since yelling activated flight or fight response I now have stored trauma."" Like c'mom, just keep your dam room clean and help your mom. Stop acting like a victim. Don't even get me started about everyone on there self diagnosing with ADHD. 

5. Just trends in general. It just discourages authenticity and originality. I feel like I see the same shit over and over. this post is long enough already so I'll just keep this point short. 

Anyway, sorry if it seemed long and rambly. I guess I needed to get all my thoughts out and thought this sub may be the best place.",2023-03-05 01:33:53,1677980033

I didn't even plan it to be that way, but somehow, this week, I did everything I planned to, took care of some errands I've been carrying around for a while, planned other events and did all my to dos this week. I feel like it's a mixture of not being as lethargic anymore (because being online a lot makes me lethargic) and simply having nothing better to do. Technically, it's semester holidays and I have a lot of free time but it didn't really feel like that before sometimes.

there were even times this week when I was just in my room, laying in my bed,
doing nothing because I had nothing to do. usually, Id fill up minutes like these immediately with scrolling, but without, I just took the time to just be and do nothing.

I read 490 pages of a Stephen King book which has been kind of my replacement entertainment. I know I need to take care of that not taking over, too, though as I can binge on books in an unhealthy way as well.

when I'm not online as much, I feel more alive and more ""inside of life"" as opposed to on its shore, observing other people live.

I often have urges to use IT for entertainment when I'm stressed and/ or exhausted. then I just want to take my mind off everything and not do anything productive at all. then, I long for some easy entertainment online. I also cut added sugar not too long ago and I feel I don't yet have any healthy coping mechanisms to replace my unhealthy habits.",2023-03-03 22:29:45,1677882585
nosurf,Recommend app or adjustments to iOS screen time?,"I use iOS screen time limits on my phone which have seemed to help overall. But I too often just override with the pass code to get another 15 minutes or an hour. 

Is there a way I can set it up so that after I hit my limit, there is no way to override until a set number of minutes or hours?  Like a “cooldown” period or something. If not, is there an 3rd party app that does that?",2023-03-03 20:41:37,1677876097
nosurf,I seriously think quitting cold turkey might not be the best solution.,"Tl;dr: I honestly think quitting cold turkey isn't gonna work for the majority of people.  
For people who don't know the term, quitting cold turkey is when you stop using your phone completely and abruptly, usually by throwing it away or deleting all your apps. It can be effective, but it can also be dangerous and harmful to your mental health.

the main thing I think is that quitting cold turkey can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from the world around you. Our phones are often our primary means of communication and staying connected with friends, family, and the world. Cutting off this connection completely can be overwhelming and make you feel more alone than ever.

And then also, quitting cold turkey can also lead to a relapse. Going from using your phone all the time to not using it at all can be a huge shock to your system, and it’s easy to fall back into old habits when faced with this kind of drastic change.

So, what’s the alternative? In my opinion, it’s all about moderation and finding a balance. Instead of quitting cold turkey, I think educating yourself about addiction, finding a support system, and slowly reducing your screen time limits (you can even start the limit at like 10 hours or something!) can really help stave off withdrawal symptoms and help you gain momentum. Like imagine if everyday you had reasonable goals to achieve in terms of phone addiction. That really makes a difference everyday.

Thanks for reading, and I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences with phone addiction and quitting cold turkey.  


By the way, feel free to reach out anytime to me via reddit chat. I love hearing your stories and listening to your problems. I'm all ears. I'm still in the thick of it in terms of addiction, but everyday I gain new thoughts and ideas at how to get better.",2023-03-03 17:17:19,1677863839

nosurf,I went Cold Turkey for 10 days from 17th to 27th February 2023. No Cheating.,"# Hey kids, Long Time Lurker Here: ✍️(◔◡◔)

On 16th February I decided to make a promise with myself and went full Cold Turkey. Basically no net on phone, AT ALL, and laptop only for work related stuff. Mindless surfing was permanently off the table, and I also completely banned myself from lurking on any fandom, news, reddit discussion etc. I also didn't stop consuming paper news, but did stop reading online news and oh boy the difference between the two is pretty stark, even though I'd still discourage reading paper news too since it is seriously designed to increase fear and anxiety. 

Let me start off by saying: **That was the hardest thing I've ever done.**

I would randomly open/close my phone, would feel the creeping sensation of boredom way too often, and exhibited frustration every time I found myself the only one not with a phone at the family dinner table.

**But DAMN was it worth it.**

Everyday felt so slow, and each day was tough, but I didn't die. In fact, it gave me a sort of clarity that I desperately needed. It also  I also recognized some personal patterns which I wouldn't have noticed otherwise. Basically if I had to sum up:

# What I learned/ Benefits: (❁´◡`❁)

1. **Mental Clarity:** 10 days of Hardcore Nosurf gave me a sort of clarity that I desperately needed. Initially my thoughts were very loud and all over the place, but the more time I spent no consuming the more sense I could make of things around me. It also prompted me to make some very important decisions. I had abandoned self-improvement because I felt I was going nowhere, but after reflecting I've decided to give it one final shot before throwing in the towel. 
2. **Reduced Needless Consideration:** You know needlessly thinking about how your action will be perceived by others? Yeah, the minute I recognized that I've considerably reduced thinking about how other people will react. Whether they're happy/sad/ angry about a decision I MADE is none of their business and neither am I responsible for their reaction. I've only got one life, I don't have time for worrying FOR others. 
3. **Actually Taking Action:** The former two, accompanied by a huge amount of boredom, prompted me to take action after a year of feeling lethargic, and six months of aimlessly existing. Also the other points wouldn't have occurred if I didn't take action. Seriously, don't underestimate the power of action; size really doesn't matter in this case either.
4. **Concentration:** My ability to focus is still garbage, but it's leagues better than before I started the challenge. I will say that you have to build concentration. Nosurf is a good first step, but you need to read and build up your ability to focus. Consistently redirecting your attention after losing during a reading session is unbelievably helpful. But without NoSurf I wouldn't have taken the first step :)
5. **Confronting My Upsetting Behaviours:** Thank goodness I'm not in the dating scene right now, cuz boy if I was I'd have the most exes and would be dubbed *'that bitch'*.  I mean the number of upsetting behavioural patterns I noticed during those 10 days was VERY alarming. Like actually yelling when I'm upset, pent-up anger and just despising people in general and many more; I was so caught off guard each time I learned a little bit about myself. Soon I found myself working on that stuff using the free time I had gained.
6. **Confronting My Fears:** So basically all those bad behaviours I mentioned? Yeah, found out all of them stemmed from a lot of bottled up fears and betrayals. Obviously I couldn't work on all of them in 10 days, but I did get a bit of an overview into what I was dealing with. I don't wanna go too much in depth, but lets just say it's been preventing me from working functionally for a while now. Actually working up the courage to confront some of them, and identifying most of them reduced my resentment &amp; disgust towards everything. 
7. **Time:** It isn't even funny how much time felt slowed during this experience. I could actually think for once and had so many hours to do whatever I liked. I addressed the backlog of books, studying and courses I had been neglecting for months; this isn't even mentioning the new hobbies and routines I'm trying to pick up again like daily morning walking, driving, finding new sports and searching for festivals and events happening in my city. But the most important thing out of this, was the time I got to restructure my future goals and confront some of my bad habits. 
8. **Leveraging Social Media:** *Hear me out!* I totally understand the way social media is designed to be deliberately addictive and trap you into wasting time for hours; as someone who has a seriously addictive personality, I haven't had a social media account for at least 7-8 years, but I still used to regularly lurk on Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram etc. So not having an account didn't do jack to reduce my consumption. Also, a really important thing I realized during Nosurf was that having a social media account is seriously important for staying in touch/ for networking. I'm a graduate and I seriously need it to network with peeps and stay in touch, since I don't have the time to call for a bit either. I totally understand how addicting it is though, so I do plan to put some limitations on it when I do make an account. I seriously think we should find a way to make different social media platforms work like a tool rather than using it to feel miserable about ourselves. Still trying to figure out how to though ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

# That's Nice, but now what? ┌( ಠ_ಠ)┘

Welp after this post goes up I'll respond for the next 24\~48 hrs then go on to create some actual goals for myself that I actually want out of life. See, after the ten days were over, I immediately went on a binge and regretted it greatly; actual headaches ensued after that.  I realized aimlessness has a big role to do with that, plus my very very very real fears which haven't been entirely resolved. After that I make another promise with myself, which is basically to undergo:

***THE 90 DAYS NOSURF CHALLENGE***

Often I don't find a lot of helpful NoSurf challenge guidelines on this sub, so I decided to make one on my own. This is gonna be based off of my 10 days experience and the idea that it takes 90 days on average for a habit to form.

**Guidelines for the Challenge:**

1. No Lurking or mindless Surfing on Laptop &amp; Phone.
2. No Browser usage on Phone. If you have to use it for looking up something, than total usage time cannot be more than 1 hr per day. After that use your laptop. (Also I use YourHour app to track my daily usage for each app, but any tracking app will do)
3. Instagram, Facebook &amp; Twitter are to be accessed through Laptop. Total Time for all three would be one hour during evening tea (5-6 pm). Home feed cannot be accessed for Facebook, and trending tab is off the table for Twitter. Also no politics, fandoms, &amp; self-moralising bullshit topics can be surfed.
4. Work related stuff to be accessed via Laptop. 
5. Sunday is the only day I can access Youtube for two hours WITH recommendation blocker extension. This is basically to catch up with some music stuff, and actually insightful channels.
6. Streak system: Follow for 90 days, and if you break one of the rules you need to restart the challenge. 

That's all I wanted to say. Thank you for actually reading this wall of text if you actually did :) Thoughts? Questions? Just wanna chat? Go right ahead. Remember: you can beat this addiction, that much was clear to be when I reached the end of the 10th day mark, but you've gotta have a strong purpose followed by an actual strategy. 

You've got this.",2023-03-03 13:24:09,1677849849
nosurf,I spent the last 30mins trying to pin down good advices that de-addicted me hoping they'd help you.,"But honestly, The more I wrote the more I realised there wasn't definite answers I could give anyone struggling with this addiction.

For me, it just happened. The conscious decision on my part was sleeping at 22:30 and waking up at 05:30 every day. And spending the first hour studying. It extended to 3hrs and before I knew extended to 6hrs everyday.

In that time I also started lifting weights. Started with 3x5 then 4x4 then 3x6 and like so incrementally, extremely slowly, increased my input.

A bunch of other good habits like that added slowly. Started walking outside ^(I'm ^not ^diligent ^with ^that ^however ^right ^now. ^But ^I ^have ^no ^doubt ^I ^can ^make ^it ^a ^habit ^whenever ^I ^pin ^down ^a ^routine ^for ^it), started talking to my family and friends more, started doing a few projects, started writing way more, started reading a bit. 

It all happened so slowly. I think the main driving force was studying. I think it gave me a purpose to leave internet behind. 

But really, it all happened so very slowly that I don't know what to tell you. I got stronger, smarter, kinder, wiser.

The only thing I can say is for you to start studying and applying yourself in it. Get a purpose. A purpose that feels good and apply yourself in it.

You know yourself best. If you don't know yourself. Write in a personal notebook for an hour everyday.",2023-03-03 12:52:35,1677847955
nosurf,Social media and the very much Reddit is absolutely useless for broader things apart hobbies [uncensored venting],"Seriously. The amount of toxicity that slice of life topics get are unbelievable. The most common things that people agree on and find quite useful are hobbies in which they share similar point of views, experiences and tips, but apart from that it's quite impossible to be excited about the content that is posted. Heck, sometimes even hobby subs act full of arrogant arse when they bash into a corner a rookie or someone who just can't find a simple question or in case they need updated information. I recall the last time when I posted in a need of an identification for an old audio speaker. Instead of people actually trying to identify and aid in the discovery of that model - they told me to throw that antique into the trash bin, before I sold it for $200 :). Or that time when I expressed my struggle to date after a year of break up, because I want long term relationship and many just settled on a grand opinion to give up when most of them have never had a girlfriend.

I don't want to generalize, because there are much more empathic, honest and cool people out there in the social sites, unfortunately, the most ones that we encounter due to their vocalness are horrible people in real life or are trolls, who knows  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ . But yeah, I'll probably quit Reddit after this post, but the worst part is that it's fucking tough to sort through information that sometimes isn't available on the surface level search engines and at that moment I just address to Reddit or other social site for help.

nosurf,Hating technology is ruining my mental health,"I’m 18 and ever since tiktok has become more popular I noticed people are way more obsessed with their phones and it’s all they care about now. I feel like I can’t make connections with anyone because nobody is genuine anymore and most conversations involve social media and even their personality revolves around it. It feels like people don’t have deep conversations anymore either like people used to be able to just talk for hours and hang out but now if there’s even a minute of silence people are back on their phones scrolling and it just feels like there’s a wall up between me and everyone else. All I want is for phones to not exist or to go back to 2000s/2010s when there was phones but people weren’t overly obsessed.

I thought the solution was to stop using my phone so much so I’ve been trying that but I feel even more depressed because I see everyone else using their phones 24/7 and it makes me feel like I’m doing this for nothing and this generation is just hopeless. 

it’s like everyone is blinded by technology they have no self awareness of how bad it is for you or how addicted they really are. I just feel so sad and angry all the time about it. 

I know it’s a dumb thing to be depressed about idk why I feel this way but I just literally feel like life isn’t worth living in this generation. I don’t know how to change things and how to stop being sad I feel like things will only get worse but I just want to be happy. 

I’m just writing this to maybe find some hope that things aren’t really that bad or some advice on what to do to not feel like this",2023-03-03 08:55:00,1677833700
nosurf,My biggest tip for reducing social media use (Iphone),"I have adhd and find it impossible to get off my phone unless I have it blocked with this method or if I’m busy irl.


Basically all you do is set a passcode for your screentime and limit the amount of time you can use certain apps. I make a random passcode and write it down somewhere (i forget things quite easily, you can probably forget it too if you can refrain from using it for a week or 2). You can turn off the passcode by entering your apple ID, so that’s the main area where you need extra willpower. 


I have all my social media apps limited to 5 minutes a day, aside from instagram having an hour on weekends so that I can post on my stories. This allows me to at least get some satisfaction during the day of scrolling but it will lock me out and once i’ve used all my time my phone becomes pretty boring. 


I also have it so that between 10pm and 7pm almost every app is blocked except my essentials that I do not scroll on. (sometimes i find myself scrolling through my emails lol)


Just make sure you set it to “Block at end of time limit” so that it doesn’t give you the option of adding more time.


After using this method for about a year now I have greatly reduced my screen time. When I turn off the passcode (eg on holidays) I do go back to scrolling addiction mode, but now I am in the routine of turning it back on when I need to be productive again.


If anyone needs help setting this up i’m happy to post a little picture tutorial :)",2023-03-03 07:27:26,1677828446

I was able to easily delete SO MANY negative subs I was constantly seeing everyday! I never realized how depressed and angry they made me feel.

nosurf,Cold Turkey blocker permanent block,"I’ve been using cold Turkey blocker for my computer, and have run into a big problem.

I used frozen Turkey to block my computer for 3 or 4 days in a row. Set to shut down my computer - Permanent, 24 hours a day.

For some reason, now a week later it’s still shutting my computer down. 

I’ve noticed that sometimes if you set any type of block it will set itself will continue to block itself even when the timer is done. The only way to turn it off is to manually turn it off. 

I’m worried that’s what is happening. If that’s the case I basically would be locked out of my computer with no way to turn the block off.

nosurf,A realization that has helped….,"For me it’s been huge to fully realize and remind myself I just don’t like spending time on the internet.

I used to smoke heavily, and had the same realization. Now it’s something I don’t even think about it or crave in the slightest. 

Not saying this will apply for everyone but maybe there’s someone else out there that would resonate with this. If you’re truly sick of the scrolling and the time wasting and etc….. really go deep and ask yourself if there’s anything about those activities that you enjoy. If you come to the realization that you truly DO NOT, continually remind yourself that. Drill it into your head and belief system. Before you know it , you won’t be reaching for the phone nearly as much.",2023-03-03 00:57:07,1677805027
nosurf,dealing with 10+ years of internet addiction,"I don't know if this is the right sub to post to because my addiction is linked with various issues going on in my life. I started by playing games online when I was little. Back then there has been a limit to it since my parents controlled my time spent on the internet. But when my mom fell ill it has been sort of my escape.  


After her death I remember my dad would ask ""why don't you play games on your pc?"". He wanted me to be distracted from all of it. I was just eight at that time. From there on it grew into an uncontrollable addiction of mine to a point where **he had to throw away a router he bought for me**.  


My interest across the web has changed as I grew up. It went from playing games to pop culture obsession. When I was 12-13 I've been 24/7 on Facebook talking to this one guy who were in his 20s at that time. I was stupid at that time. Now that I'm at their age I realize everything and I hate that person so much.   


When I grew out of it then I had this obsession with college reaction videos and applications from The US. I feel like it had been my healthiest obsession so far. I did really well at school during those times, I was really into learning and participated in many things. I've wanted to participate for this olympiad and bought books for it. I remember talking to my dad about all my plans. It's been 4 years since then and I still hasn't touched those books. I'm no longer eligible to participate in it because of the age limit.  


In 9th grade (2019) I had really bad youtube addiction. I got back into my pop culture/ celebrity stuff addiction. I'm really attached to this one celebrity in particular because their personality reminds so much of my mother. Or more like I find comfort in them and see them as a filler for what I don't have. It's so bad that to this day I wake up with them in my mind first thing in the morning and think of them before I sleep. I've many extended characters of this person in my mind, doing stuff that a mom would do with her daughter. Daydream of them adopting me. I know it's so weird. I've also developed maladaptive daydreaming because of that.  


It got out of hand that I'd force myself to hate them and make myself believe they're a bad person behind camera and tries reading too much into their expressions. But people that have met them personally have only good things to talk about and I hate myself for trying to picture them as a bad person.   


On top of that I've developed an asmr addiction and a serious music addiction. Like I could spend days just listening to music. Even one of my friend called me out for it. My dad also would always comes to check in if i'm listening to any music. It's just so easy for me to zone out while listening to music.

All of my addictions roots back to me trying to find comfort. It has affected my grades so badly and it's even worse that I'm typing all this few hours prior to an exam. I can't even talk to my dad about this. We are not that close and mental health is such a taboo topic to even talk about. **It's just that you are lazy, not mentally suffering.**   


I do have a step mom and I'm grateful for her. But we are more like house mates if I'm being honest.   


I just have no idea what I'm supposed to do. I've been trying to quit for 4 years and at this point I feel like I've watched all videos on youtube about self care and self growth. I really don't wanna die like this. I want to be someone who my parents would be proud of. Who I can be proud of. I don't know how to go about this",2023-03-03 00:00:45,1677801645
nosurf,Casual internet (aka mindless surfing) allowed from 9.30 PM to 11 PM and that's it,"I've tried many different methods of limiting my internet use and waste of time. All of them failed.

Why? Because once I'm online, it's difficult to control the amount of time I spend there, and also the types of activities...

So, I think the only solution is to give up trying to control it... and let my self freely enjoy the Internet in its fullness, but only in a specifically allocated time slot, and that is, (as per my own decision... you might choose something else)

from 9.30 PM to 11 PM.

90 minutes... plenty of time to enjoy surfing the Net.

Outside of this time slot, I can use the Internet only for following:

1) WORK (including replying to work emails)

2) STUDY (doing programming courses which I do)

3) ACTUAL HOBBIES THAT REQUIRE INTERNET CONNECTION (Playing chess on [chess.com](https://chess.com) or getting lyrics and information about the music I listen to, or even listening to whole songs online)

4) SEEKING SPECIFIC INFORMATION DIRECTLY RELATED TO WHAT I STUDY (such as Stack Overflow)

5) COMMUNICATION WITH ACTUAL FRIENDS (MESSENGER, WHATSAPP, VIBER)

6) DOWNLOADING SOFTWARE, games, etc...

7) This might be controversial to some, but I also decided to allow streaming movies outside this time slot, because I don't count it as surfing, if I actually watch a whole movie or TV show, this is a quality time, that contributes to my culture.   This exception is just for whole feature films... Netflix is OK, but not Youtube.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems very liberal and with plenty of exceptions, but hear me out... For my addicted brain those activities were never problem. Real problem was mindlessly surfing, skimming articles, switching from one youtube video to another without watching any fully, wasting time on Reddit, etc...

MINDLESS SURFING in general is the problem.

So I know I can't quit it in today's day and age, but for this reason, I decided to limit it to a dedicated time slot, so that the rest of the time is free from surfing.",2023-03-02 22:00:35,1677794435

It's a five-year-old, paid off iPhone. The screen didn't even crack (I've dropped it many times and yet the screen hasn't cracked somehow) but the internal hardware must have broke because the phone went berserk then just died.

I've been dreaming hard about just getting rid of my phone for months now. As soon as I realized the phone was dead, I decided instantly I wouldn't replace it. In fact I felt relief--like \*finally\*. It was that easy, and yet I've hesitated getting rid of it, because I'm a digital nomad and use the GPS quite frequently.

I'm in a new city where I just arrived yesterday and don't speak the language. In order to get home, I had to stop into a random hotel and ask the front desk for a physical map. Now I'm going to just make it work without a phone going forward. I've already emailed the handful of people who might need to contact me.

At least now I know that whenever I'm outside of my apartment, it will be completely free of screentime. I already have a timer lock for my laptop when I'm home.

Cos someone has asked them where they're from &amp; they answered &amp; it's somewhere on the continent.

I think it's so stupid. Not everyone on the internet is going to be the same as you.

This is just one example (I just saw) but there's other versions of it. 

It's like it's gone from 'does this contribute to the conversation?' to 'do you agree with this person?' to 'does this person match you?' in terms of how it gets used.",2023-03-02 17:26:16,1677777976
nosurf,50 to 60 hours a week on my phone... would anyone be down to talk?,"hey everyone,

I am addicted to my smartphone, spending anywhere from 30 to 60 hours a week scrolling through it. It has become my escape from reality, but it's time to face the truth that it's spiraling out of control. I'm reaching out to see if there's anyone else out there who's going through the same thing and would like to chat.

I'm not necessarily seeking guidance, although any advice is appreciated. What I'm really looking for is someone who can relate to my struggles and share their own story. To make it easier for you to reach out, I'll tell you a little about myself. I'm a college student from the US, and I have a passion for coding. It's frustrating to think about how much time I've wasted on my phone, time that could have been spent doing what I love.

If you're in the same boat, I would love to connect with you. It's comforting to know that I'm not alone in this struggle.

Thanks for reading, and I hope to hear from you soon.",2023-03-02 17:26:16,1677777976
nosurf,Just Stop It,"So there you are, visiting r/nosurf, hoping for the magical solution to end your addiction to the internet, especially social media. Spoiler: there is no magical solution.

Content blockers and other tools/tricks are helpful and are an important first step, but it's naïve to think you can do it without building up your willpower. It's going to be difficult, but you can do hard things. 

I know it's frustrating to delete all of your social media, yet here you are scrolling on Reddit. What is this, your 20th account now?

I write this to call myself out as I wrote a similar mental breakdown post in a Discord server that I was way too addicted to, and that seems to have been the kicker that made me not want to ever go back. I think if we want to help ourselves, we have to be brutally honest with ourselves.

It's a process, and as someone else said, you have to hit your bottom before you finally say enough. When I look at how long it took me to let go of other social media apps for good, while some were easy to let go of because they never really appealed to me to begin with, a rude awakening had to take place in order to finally be done with others.

This is mine and yours will most likely be different but I wish you best of luck in tackling this addiction put on all of us by big tech.

With that, I'm done. I'm not coming back. Here's to getting outside, having in real life conversations, pursuing healthier habits/hobbies, and still finding what is good in the world....it's there if we're willing to look (and do our own part to add to the good).

Bye!",2023-03-02 16:51:04,1677775864
nosurf,Making YouTube Less Distracting And More Useful For My Purposes,"In letting of most social media apps, I find myself turning to Reddit and YouTube more often as a replacement.

Eventually, I will have to deal with Reddit but right now my focus on how to make Youtube less of a time waster for me and how to use it more effectively. My process in how I am getting there, maybe this can help someone else: 

1. I deleted the app from my phone and installed a content blocker to prevent myself from visiting certain websites, social media in particular. 
2. Though there are some apps that can block both the website and correlating app, that didn't work for me so in addition to above, I turned on screen time for iOS and turned off my Safari browser, kept only necessary apps, even deleted my music apps, and turned off my App Store to keep myself from downloading any more apps. My thought process is that by creating extra friction, I have to really think about if it's worth it to do so. I also put my phone in grayscale and I actually like it better, now that I am used to it. It doesn't grab my attention as easily.
3. On my computer, I only have Microsoft Edge and Chrome. I don't really use Edge but added the extension 'Self Control' to block all social media sites including Reddit and YouTube. On Chrome, I like 'Undistracted' as it allows me to toggle on and off for blocking different sites, plus I can add extra links for sites that are most problematic for me. I discovered for myself that if I am too strict and can't get to any of it at all, the rebellion in me gets louder and I find myself scrolling more so that's why 'Undistracted' is a win for me.
4. With the above, I am also able to block YouTube if I need to, but I also use 'Unhook' to hide the homepage recommendations, top header/search bar, comments, and I have unsubscribed from everything except for a couple exercise channels, with YouTube set to go to my subscriptions, so that, hopefully, I will be prompted to do some movements that are good for me instead of just mindlessly searching, scrolling, and watching. Other than that, I just have a couple tv shows and a few movies that I purchased a while ago in my library. By limiting what I am allowed to watch but not totally restricting myself, I am hopeful that it will help me get my time back.
5. I pay for YouTube premium and I understand that maybe that's not an option for everyone, but as it has been said, if you're not paying for it, you are the product.
6. I think these tips will work well if I am on the computer though I am trying to also only watch YouTube on the TV, I just wish there was a way to turn off the homepage recommendations, etc. for Firestick. Though it helps that there is no way to engage with comments on TV and through my YouTube settings, I was able to turn of the inplay videos of recommended cards so that when I hover an image, I have time to think if I really want to watch the video without the video already playing in the thumbnail.

Anyway, that's where I am at so far and it feels good. I hope this helps anyone who may have been having the same issue. 

Take care.",2023-03-02 14:57:24,1677769044

They are very useful for seeing progress and stuff, but... Aren't there too much of them? I feel like every action IRL life is accompanied with taking my phone and pressing buttons. Like It's bad to just do something and don't check it.

It's tricky, because it's no social media or scrolling. But I feel like it's a huge reliance on a phone. **So please, tell me what you think of it, what apps do you use and how you manage them.**

More specific question: **how to you train in a gym (fir those who do)? Do you have some program in memory, or use an app telling you what to do each day?

nosurf,My years long journey of reeling in my internet addiction.,"Let me preface this by saying that I was a long-term Facebook user, joining at the end of middle school around the time they opened up the site to non-college students.  This has been my general path towards getting away from my phone, and it's taken roughly 7 years of life changes to get to this point.  The general trend is that I identified something that was gluing me to my phone and tried to find some more productive alternative.

* Kicking Facebook and Instagram was the first step.  I used to be a pretty active user, but I was getting stressed out by their censorship and assistance with the surveillance state, their usage of AI to hold people's attention, etc.  This was actually fairly easy to replace with in person interaction because I was part of an activist organization that pushed this anyway.  This was my main form of pulling away for a while but I was still pretty glued to things like reddit and YouTube.

*I had a slow process of replacing daily gaming with Yoga.  This was actually pretty hard but I would just force myself to do a yoga video instead of turning on my PS4 before work.  Yoga was really important establishing a routine away from my phone.  It felt too good and trained my concentration.

*I got a cheap phone that could only really use reddit/browsing and YouTube as outlets for entertainment effectively.

*I left a job I despised that I was slacking off on YouTube all day.  New job is way better and my 5g is really bad at the office.

*My daughter was born, pushing me to be more present, killed what was left of my daily gaming career, and I also want to be a good model for tech usage for her.

*Started journaling which has taken up even more of my time, and helped me have an alternative outlet to posting on Reddit.  It also has a stabilizing effect on my mood.

*I recently turned my phone grayscale, it is now almost painful to look at for more than a couple minutes, and I almost immediately get bored after just a couple minutes of scrolling.  Reddit and YouTube are almost totally unappealing without color.

*I see the light at the end of the tunnel, my goal right now is to stop using reddit completely and only journal (this post was actually from my journal).  I also want to only use YouTube for music at work.  I feel like I've almost successfully reigned in my smartphone usage and could potentially move to a flip phone.  I don't actually use my phone much anymore and just wanted to post my guide t hopefully help others out.",2023-03-02 02:06:10,1677722770

what has personally helped / has helped other people

* identifying triggers and why you personally use tech - then setting up barriers (working with friends - putting phone or modem away after a certain time...)
* building healthier habits - working out - finding a hobby like tennis or dancing
* sleeping better (better sleep lowers stress and improves self-control)
* relying on a support group / building a support group (telling friends or family or someone about your struggle and asking them for help - sharing whenever a relapse occurs). this can be really difficult as you need someone who is fully supportive and non-judgmental
* some form of screen blocker in conjunction with something else
* therapy \[CBT / motivational mainly\] / support groups (useful but expensive and more of an aid than anything else - all the work is done outside of the therapy sessions / support groups)
* journaling and meditation (meditation and journaling can improve self-monitoring)

a realization that has helped me: this does not define you. it's not because of some deficit of character. there isn't anything intrinsically wrong with you. it's all just learned behaviors, however illogical, that help to fill something that you need in your life.",2023-03-01 23:31:40,1677713500

nosurf,Unpopular Opinion: We need to stop denigrating those who want people back in the office as if they were money grubbing plantation owners. Work-from-home is accelerating the loneliness and screen time addiction problem tenfold.,"It seems that a sizable amount of people are absolutely insisting that we should encourage full time work-from-home at every possible turn that it's available; but then a lot of the same people are admitting to doing nothing but mindlessly scrolling on their phone, napping through the work day, and/or delivering pretty much every thing they need right to their homes without ever leaving to shop for stuff.

I'm not sure if it's congruent to accept that there is an atomization problem, while also saying that people who are advocating to get people back in the office are wrong in wanting to do so.

nosurf,Looking for fellow tech addicts to interview!,"I was given my first phone in 3rd grade. It changed everything. My parents tried to strictly regulate my usage but I found it easy to evade their rules. For most of my childhood I wasn't allowed to keep my phone in my room, which was good. The only problem was that I would just sneak upstairs, grab it, and binge YouTube until early into the morning. Yet, I was far from the only one. Many of my friends did similar things. The novelty of the phone and easy access to limitless content was just so captivating.

Fast forward many, many years and I have become more conscious of my addiction than ever before. It became obvious that my phone was just a pacifier, enabling me to escape from my problems and irrational anxiety. I learned that this anxiety was causing me to run to my phone instead of just addressing it head on. It got to the point that my whole weekend was just me watching YouTube from the moment I woke up till the late evening or early hours of the morning. It numbed the pain. I felt absolutely miserable and lost all mental clarity and ability to focus. 

Thankfully, this was the bottom for me. I couldn't take it anymore. I knew I had to change. I deleted Instagram and Snapchat, two apps I used with great frequency. I forced all my friends and family to contact me through WhatsApp or Signal. I separated purely entertaining content and productivity content into two separate YouTube accounts. That has worked like magic. I realized life isn't worth wasting staring at a screen. 

Yet, I would never go as far as regressing to a flip-phone or cutting tech out of my life entirely. Fundamentally, I believe tech can be a major net-benefit for us if we use it optimally. It's just very hard to do so and very few of us actually do. 

Recently I've begun researching fellow tech addicts and hearing their stories with the aim of hopefully building an app that enables all of us to rid ourselves of this terrible, terrible addiction and do something valuable with our short lives.

I’m repulsed by the idea of posting my life now. It just seems silly to me. Posting stories and letting people I barely talk to have a view into my life at any time isn’t appealing to me anymore.

I try to call and text them but it’s not the same as social media, they post every day but barely stay in touch in real life.

I take pictures of myself and just keep them on my phone, I don’t care for people to see me or I what I’m doing, and they don’t understand the point of doing that. 

Everyone talks about what they posted, what this person posted, and I just don’t care about that stuff anymore. It makes me feel lonely and unrelate-able. I just talk to my counselor weekly and my mom daily. I live with my boyfriend but these are the only people I speak to.

I used to be so social, both irl and online. I had more friends and felt connected with people, even those I don’t know all too well. I’ve missed out on birthdays and other important announcements. I used to have an “online presence” and now feel like everyone has forgotten me.

2 years ago I had over a hundred and twenty people wishing me happy birthday. I just checked and this year? 12.

It’s not that I care so much about the birthday thing, I get it.. but I’ve completely lost any sense of connection with most people except for the people that are willing to keep up an irl relationship, which is like, 5.

And now I’ve been out of the loop for so long, I don’t even really know how to get started again. I’m not in the habit anymore of reading, liking, and commenting on others’ posts and I don’t really know what my “voice” is anymore or what I should say.

I moved to a new city last summer which has made it even harder. It’s like once I moved, friends back in my last city just sort of dropped off the map. When I moved the time before that in 2018, I maintained contact with people in the city I lived in prior through social media and it was great.

This isn’t the rebound effect that’s typical within weeks of quitting, it’s been so long and now feels like an experiment gone wrong. People live their lives on social media now and it almost feels selfish that I’m no longer participating in their lives. I do read reddit for an hour or so every day, but it’s not the same.

nosurf,The difference is incredible,"I removed internet from all my devices and it might sound like an exagerration but it feels like taking a first breath after spending a long time underwater.

I'm writing this from a relative's device, which allows me to still do what I need to do online but with a limited time since I eventually have to give the device back.

I was aware it was bad but now that I regained enough self control, I realize that I was acting like a hypnotized zombi.  With internet far away, I all of a sudden felt a better sense of having control of my thoughs, my actions and my life. I drew something and I hadn't felt that much in charge in months! Usually I had so much anxietty and stress just at the idea of drawing.

Internet really does remove that feeling of being in control, I knew it was bad but with the distance it was even worst than I though.

Good luck on your efforts everyone, I hope you get to experience that feeling even for a little while.",2023-03-01 03:57:45,1677643065
nosurf,Questions from someone trying to detox,"Hi, I'm considering doing a social media detox, I've already deleted Twitter and TikTok, and so the only other two that I ever really use are reddit and YouTube. I really only use reddit when looking up stuff on Google, but I use YouTube a shitton. 

1. Is YouTube okay at all? I use it a lot for educational purposes, like lessons or tutorials, is that fine?

2. If I stop watching YouTube, what is the logical endpoint? Should I stop watching streaming services, as well? Is it more about watching professional, curated content?

2. Should I only be reading and watching things I have physically? Or should I be working up to avoiding all media consumption, or just ones that do not provide informational content? 

3. How do video games work into this as well? I don't play a lot of video games, but I feel like with all the free time I gain it would probably become bigger.

4. Does Spotify count as social media? I know this is stupid, but music is like the one thing that I can't cut. What about podcasts?

5. Is it better to go cold turkey, or slowly ween off of using these services, and if so, which are the most important social media services to get rid of.",2023-03-01 00:49:28,1677631768

nosurf,day 5 check in - sober celebration,"yesterday, I had my last exam for this semester. usually, my celebration of this consisted of a big bag of cheap sweets and YouTube. I did feel a bit like I had no way to celebrate it anymore.

after the exam, I ate at the uni with some other students, afterwards I went to the library at home I put on music, made a warm bath, felt guilty about the upcoming energy bill and then read the book I had borrowed whirl bathing. I then napped and at night went out to some end of semester party with some fellow students.

this was one of the days where nosurf really felt amazing. I felt good and I knew how different I would've felt if I had binged on sweets and online entertainment as always.

nosurf,"If we want a more positive experience on the internet, it's up to us to make a change.","Content creators love using clickbait titles to get more views, especially on YouTube. They manipulate with our emotions and they know that the more negative or scandalous the title is, or the more negative they make the content out to be when, chances are, it might not even be that deep because they know that is what gets the most views. We know this from The Social Dilemma on Netflix.

I find it especially annoying when they say, ""be sure you clicked that like and subscribe button...and don't forget to comment"" further manipulating us to engage how they want instead of allowing us to think for ourselves. They seem to love manipulating us with the idea that Youtube loves to remove subscribers.  Whether that is true or not, I do not know, but it's not up to these creators to manipulate me into subscribing to content that I don't want to. Because here's a hard pill for them to swallow: maybe people don't like their content or they unsubscribe from their channel because their content sucks. Or maybe it doesn't and it's just as simple as the content no longer aligns with what the viewer needs.

There are some content creators who I think do a great job with the content they create and some have served me well in helping me do better in one way or another. Eventually, though, there comes a point where one just knows it is time to move on to something else and that is okay.

In my opinion, negative clickbait might get the immediate short-term gain, but it's not sustainable and I still have hope for the kindness that is in all of us.

It's often easier to just click on the negative things that seems so readily available, and it doesn't mean to say that there isn't value in having a respectful dialogue to call out what needs to be changed, but if we want to see more positive, value-given content, it's up to us. 

I think it's important to take breaks from the internet, but it can also be a valuable if used wisely. We were never really taught how to use this responsibly, but I don't think it's too late to learn.

nosurf,another reason to stop sharing things online,"this is a sort of complicated story. bear with me.

i got an email today from my ex who i go way back with. we both used a social media site when we were younger. i deleted all social media about a year ago. the email contained a video of some random tiktoker (is this how you say it?) trying to find an online ""lost connection"", describing someone with the same username as an internet friend we had.....10 YEARS AGO!

the tiktoker was sharing personal details about this person in the hopes that their thousands of followers would help them connect....and my friend asked me if i could help. initially i was curious. i dug up the most recent mutual connections i could without having any social media accounts of my own, and quickly gave up. then i used what i remembered of them to give one last attempt. then i found in the comments of some random post the new username of the person the tiktoker described. it took me 30 minutes to find this person.

yet i have never met them. i know their face from selfies, and their internet alias, and now that i found their account i can read about where they live and what they do for work. they are not on one of the bigger social media sites. they clearly have less than 10 followers on their account. they probably assume they are not findable. yet, tiny bits of information about them have been remembered by total strangers and are now being blasted across tiktok a decade later. to thousands of strangers, including daily updates on their search.

not having been plugged in, i feel so weird about this. what is wrong with people sharing this kind of thing so publicly? and what are the ethics here?

 i entrusted the new username to my ex, asked them to ask for the consent first of our old internet friend before giving it to the tiktoker. it's out of my hands now. this just has me feeling uncomfortable about what i shared online in the past, and if similar weird videos made by people who THINK they knew me but didn't (because the internet is not real life..) could be floating around describing me and looking for me , sharing my story to an audience.",2023-02-28 09:34:55,1677576895

nosurf,Something I've Noticed,"Recently I've noticed that the internet has overall been making me feel more stressed, confused, just worse overall, and I think I can kind of explain why.

First of all, I'm 16yo and autistic, in case that helps provide more information or helps anyone relate.

I tend to worry too much what other people think about things. Whenever I have really like something or have an opinion on something, it feels like it's hard for me to enjoy it/believe it without hearing other people's thoughts - I seem to need validation. So I seek it on the internet, but I also worry about bias, so I try to look at opposing views. But the opposing views are often super harsh, and make me feel hurt or offended. I really noticed this recently because I realized that I'm probably transgender. (Still not 100% sure) And it seems that everything surrounding the topic is all politics, disagreements, and I'm having a hard time sifting through all the information. I always worry ""well what if the other side is actually right?"" and this isn't healthy anymore. I need to stop.

If anyone has any tips for someone just getting started with trying to reduce internet usage, that would be really helpful. I don't want to stop altogether - mainly just social media.",2023-02-28 04:27:59,1677558479

It's as if everyone feels the need to be overtly critical towards everything. Any loose thread now has a giant spotlight put on it. I mean shit, most Reddit threads have at least a dozen people eager to call you out on something no matter how big or small. Is this really making the world a better place? I don't think so.

I haven't found anything, I tried through meta account center and failed. Can't seem to find any third-party apps for this. Apparently, there used to be an official app for IG DM's but it got killed.

nosurf,How to reconcile need for support with NoSurf?,"So I've created a separate throwaway account for this, to protect privacy.   I currently live under conditions that make in-person socializing difficult to impossible - I have to be very COVID-cautious and really can't see people in person.  (My reasons for this and my boundaries with this are not up for debate and will be omitted from the current discussion - I really don't want to derail it here).

Thing is, I live within a bubble of five people, including myself.  Two are elderly and in the incipient stages of dementia that occasionally comes out as angry and racist Fox News rants.  One is severely mentally ill; the mental illness is well-controlled, but occasionally comes out in abusive episodes directed at me.  The remaining one is a small child (with a high-risk health condition).  In other words, there are many times in my life when I really, honestly, don't have a sane grownup to talk to in person, and don't have anywhere to turn for relief from all the insanity around me.  The past few days, unfortunately, have been like that.  The elderly folks are in their racist phase and the mentally ill person is in their abusive phase, at the same time.

I've found some measure of support and community on Reddit and Facebook, and it's been a tremendous relief to talk to other folks in the same situation as myself.  It's also been a great source of information in my quest to remain COVID-cautious and to continue to protect myself and my family; the information I've obtained on these networks has kept everyone COVID-free so far, and taking time away from them has prevented me from taking steps I need to take to protect everyone.

So I find that the typical NoSurf reasoning of ""Social media is a giant waste of time!"" really doesn't resonate with me.  But that said, I also don't want to be sucked in to social media to the exclusion of all other things, especially given my situation.  I allowed myself more time on Facebook and Reddit last month, and found that I'm not reading books anymore and that I am twitchy when away from Reddit/Facebook for too long, and I don't like that.

For those of you who do rely on social media for actual practical things (whatever those actual practical things may be), how do you draw the line?  Is there a healthy way to draw that line?",2023-02-26 20:10:53,1677442253

I tried to quit cold turkey before but it's really hard as my brain is just not used to it and I just fail. Is it a good approach to eliminate activities one by one? for example right now I quit videogames and anytime I feel like playing them I either read my book or play guitar when I'm at home. I want to extend this to eventually limiting my social media/youtube time to let's say 2 hours a day. ( I probably spend 5+ hours every day now)

Relay has less of that, and even a lot of the functionality that exists is hidden. I used to think it is stupid how I need to swipe to reveal controls to upvote and do other things, but maybe that makes it into a more deliberate action, and less of a sort of automatic following cravings thing. The way Android focuses on one thing at a time, without the opportunity to have many tabs and windows to choose from, maybe also help.

Nowadays there are various methods of running Android on a PC, including various emulators, Android x86, Waydroid in Linux, and the new Android support in Windows 11.

The only significant feature Relay doesn't support is chat. That's okay for me because I avoid using that anyways.",2023-02-26 18:33:36,1677436416
nosurf,"Social Media Makes People Take Everything to An Extreme, and that includes this Subreddit","It seems like social media boils every idea down to its extreme form.  Everything is the best, the worst, the salvation of humanity, or the thing that's going to end civilization.  That includes r/nosurf.

Here's a reasonable statement: *The Internet has some addictive properties, and I should try to use it less often and re-evaluate when/how/why I use it.*  

But then, I think people feel compelled to post more extreme, emotional statements.  *The Internet is the worst thing that ever happened to humanity.  Everyone who uses a smartphone is a mindless zombie.  Nobody can use ANY social media ever or it will rot your brain.  I've wasted my youth* (you think you're the first person who has struggled to break a bad habit and felt frustrated?  I promise you're not).  *All screens are bad.*  

I'm not saying that going cold turkey temporarily isn't a good idea.  I've done it several times to ""reset"" my relationship with technology, and it's a good way to evaluate how intentionally you're using it.  And it's okay to say that certain apps/activities are having a negative impact on your life.  I wound up deleting TikTok completely; just as it's easier for me to eat zero potato chips than just one, it's easier to spend zero hours on TikTok than to limit my time.

I just think that this type of black and white thinking is so pervasive on the Internet, and it's okay to have balance with all things, *including the Internet*.

Or delete all your accounts, throw your phone into the ocean, and live off the grid if that's what's best for you.  I'm not in charge of your life.",2023-02-26 18:23:44,1677435824
nosurf,Day 3 check in- big boredom,"whenever I quit IT I find myself doing the most random, mundane tasks after a few day. I feel so bored and understimulated that I would rather do other task, including uncomfortable ones than sit in my boredom.

today I found myself sorting out my music library and writing a small programm for my work after studying. I was simply so bored and in need to kill the time that mundane errands seem more appealing. it  also makes me see just how much time I let IT eat up in the weeks before, as all of this time is now free and empty.

Is there any research done to this specific part of internet usage and how it affects mood? Are there any people here who have or had something similar?

nosurf,I just realized something,"Look this may come off as a complete ""ya no shit"" moment. But I just realized something and really want to get it off my chest.
I have been no surf on and off for the past like 5 years. Something in my life happens and I hate it so I drown my feelings in social media. Things get better I want to grow as a person I shut down social media and focus on myself. Recently the cycle has been more like rampant as I have a higher stress job and my relationship has been rocky for a long time for various reasons.
Anywaysssss
A major thing I noticed when it comes to social media use is how much joy it steals from my hobbies. I used to love to knit and sew and bake... And I still do but when I'm on social media this idea of performance and perfectionism is through the roof. Like yea no one wants to make a mistake on their newest project but for me it goes beyond that... I feel this need to perform and perform in a grand way. I have a nagging feeling now when I plan a project that ok great we're going to make a dress... But what's the wow factor that we can show off? And like the wow factor is you made it dumbass but when I'm on social media following every sewer or cosplayer or knitter in the world it sets an unhealthy expectation on me to compete them.... And I don't have to. There is no one to compete with. I can make a simple sun dress and be happy but sometimes I don't feel like that's the case... Idk if this will make sense to anyone else and if it does you're probably going to be like ya no shit lol. But idk man I always knew it made me feel different about my body, my looks... But I never realized it was stealing the joy of my hobby.... And I guess if I'm being really honest with myself it comparison that is stealing my joy.... Like whoa..... Anyway thanks for the therapy session and for coming to my ted talk.",2023-02-26 13:31:49,1677418309

My issue is that I'm struggling with accepting boredom. My brain doesn't seem to understand why I should accept it when I could *never* have it instead. I could be watching YouTube doing dishes, while eating, while showering, etc, which is my current habit.

I usually don't get angry easily, but now I was suddenly thinking of all the people I felt had treated me unfairly, and so much small stuff came to my mind, like ebay sellers ripping me off or small unfriendly interactions.

nosurf,"I published my first book! ""You Should Quit Reddit"" is the resource I wish I had years ago, and it's FREE this weekend to NoSurf readers!","Hello NoSurf, this is my first post on Reddit well over a year (and I don't intend to stay for long). I was a former user of this subreddit on several different accounts from 2019–2021, and more generally a Redditor of over a decade. Like many of you I experienced the addictive pull of Reddit firsthand, which caused me to get stuck in a cycle of deleting and recreating accounts on this website, constantly declaring my desire to quit but eventually relapsing by burning countless hours scrolling through low-quality content.

I wasted the majority of my free time in my teens and twenties online. It ultimately took me over two years to shatter this cycle of addiction with Reddit and other time-wasting websites for good, in order to reclaim my time to use in a more intentional manner. My life is remarkably different now (in a very positive way) and I am well on my way towards finding fulfillment.

One of my biggest frustrations on this journey was that while we constantly hear of the negative aspects of these social media platforms — that they are harming our mental health, wasting our time, and that they are addictive — as far as I could find, almost nobody was talking about Reddit and instead only criticizing sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok. Additionally, I felt that there was a dearth of actionable advice on how to spend less time online. The audience is commonly given the ""why"" but not the ""how.""

To fix that, I have invested quite a bit of time and effort these past nine months in writing and meticulously editing *You Should Quit Reddit*. The book is divided into two parts: the first expounds on the flaws of Reddit as a platform, and the second provides readers with the practical advice, tools, and techniques needed to reform their digital habits. This book is the product of my long struggle with internet addiction, containing lessons hard-earned from repeated failure and trying again until I found success.

To get this resource into the hands of those who may get the most value from it, the eBook version of *You Should Quit Reddit* is **completely FREE** on Amazon this weekend (until Monday at midnight PST). No catch or anything, [just head to Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BWLCPQ7G) and you can get it for free (and keep it forever), then read it on a Kindle or the Kindle app on any device.

The only thing I ask is that if you end up enjoying the book and find it helpful in your life, taking a minute to leave a review on the Amazon product page would be incredibly valuable to a first-time author like myself.

I am homebrewing a batch of beer today, and during my downtime from that I will pop back on occasionally if anybody has any questions. Like I said, I have quit Reddit — so by the early evening I will be re-enabling my site blockers and never returning here. :)

Hope you all enjoy the book!

nosurf,It’s amazing how one-sided a lot of Internet engagement feels,"If you were sitting at a dinner table with a friend and said something to them, they likely wouldn’t just look at you blankly and not respond. But yet on social media and other platforms, it’s amazing how you can say something to a friend and they’ll go hours before they write a reply, if they ever say anything at all besides giving you a heart emoji or a thumbs-up. And sometimes not even that. I’m sure we’re all guilty of that at some point. 

I post on some communities outside of Reddit too and it feels like a lot of people just don’t know how to have a discussion. One of my feeds is filled with “so and so reacted to your comment” and I have lots of emoji reactions but very few people actually reply, or when they do, it tends to be a generic one-sentence response. I also write fanfic and so many people will say that they are too shy/too anxious/don’t have the spoons to comment on a story. I guess it doesn’t make sense to me how you could be so worked up that you can’t even write “hey nice job on this story” when you like something. Has the Internet and social media really made us that afraid of communication? Of course, then if a writer quits because they get upset about the lack of engagement readers aren’t happy. Well, don’t make excuses for why you can never interact then. 

Honestly it’s almost depressing at times. Like the internet set people back in social skills instead of moving us forward. Even my 60-year-old mom will often get too engrossed in her phone while I’m trying to talk to her.",2023-02-25 13:44:53,1677332693

nosurf,What should I do if I'm an online student? It makes it really hard to stop surfing!,"Hey there everyone. I'm taking some dual credit courses this year and am having a real bad surfing issue. I got rid of my smartphone about a year ago for a feature phone which stopped me from using the internet leisurely outside the house (Which I am happy with myself for), however when I am locked to my computer for classes it has gotten tough for me to break free. I typically find myself mindlessly surfing for several hours before working feverishly from 12:30 - 4:30 AM (I am currently in the mindlessly surfing phase). Not even on social media sites, just Yahoo-ing the first thing I think of. The real stinker is that I'm getting good grades which only excuses my terrible habit. Never had this issue before taking online courses this semester as all assignments were given on paper, and I would have no excuse to boot up my personal computer. 

I'm nervous about doing the nuclear option on website blocking if I need help with a problem while I'm working, but on the other hand I have determined I have zero willpower (Hence why I purchased the dumbphone instead of dumbing down my IPhone 3G).

And that idea is those “I got rid of all my social media accounts and blah blah blah” videos. For a bit of background, I’ve had social media since I was in the mid to late single digits (7-9). I’m not much older now (I’m turning 16 in a week), but I have realized how much time I’ve spent on social media and how it’s almost fucked me over. I wanna get rid of it for good. It was only two other apps that I’ve had a problem with besides reddit, and that’s instagram and tik tok. I despise tik tok because of how addictive it is and instagram because of how toxic it is, and reddit because of both reasons. I just know my anxiety has skyrocketed due to these sites, yet it’s so difficult to stay off of them. But tonight, is the last day I have any social media, and I actually mean that. I’ve realized that I only had social media because others did, it was never for me. And then I’ve tried to make it “beneficial” to me by following/joining/searching up things that I have interest in, and guess what? IT DIDN’T DO A DAMN THING, I learned jackshit from r/selfimprovement and all those other subreddits, pages, shorts, tik tokers, etc (kudos to you if you did tho!). My grades have been terrible compared to my middle school grades, and it makes me feel stupid. I know I’m intelligent, it’s just the fact that my attention is focused on what other folks are doing on tik tok, instagram, reddit, etc. Years feel like they’ve been wasted, but I’m not too old yet so I’m still good. I now know what these old folks mean when they say this generation is fucked. I just hope I can replace it with a job or anime or something. Soon that’ll include youtube, but right now I don’t believe it will because I like watching berleezy. I’ll probably stay logged in until 5:24 just to take in some advice that you all may give, but other than that, I’m done. I’m sick of the anxiety, the wasted time, the scrolling, the comparisons, the discouragement, the dependency, the EVERYTHING. Fuck this shitty fantasy world, damn near none of us truly benefit from it. And the select few that do have expressed their dislike/hatred for it.

nosurf,The real reason why most people spend too much time on the internet,"Your life just sucks. Mabye that sounds a bit rude, but for most people, this is the core of the problem.

Yes, these modern apps and websites are designed to be addictive, but that's not a big issue. Alcohol and cigarettes are addictive too, but many people are able to quit them for the health benefits.

So why do you even feel the need to numb your mind with excessive internet use?

Because your life probably isn't as interesting and fulfilling as you wish. You're a spectator most of the time, watching other people doing the things that you just dream of. That makes you vulnerable to wasting time online. The internet is the perfect escape tool for losers to distract themselves from the pain of not reaching their potential.

Look at the people you admire. Sport stars, musicians, actors, etc. Do they mindlessly scroll for multiple hours every day for distraction? No. They don't need to, because their real life is interesting enough.

nosurf,How do I stop saving everything I find on the Internet?,"I am what you would call a digital hoarder of the extreme kind. I have used Reddit for about 10 years now on my main account but ask this from an anonymous account because I think it's embarrassing. My problem is that I can't stop saving everything I see on the Internet and I don't know why. Cute video of a cat playing with a ball? Save. Video of a gas station blowing up because some idiot drove away with the gas pump hose? Save. Picture of what every country in Europe's national dish is? Save. 

You catch my drift, everything I see on Reddit, Youtube, Imgur, and other places that have this sort of format where every post is short and interesting, I will save with the thought of looking at later. The problem is that I never do look at anything later, it feels like a chore to go through it now. I don't like having thousands of videos in my 30 Youtube playlists or thousands of saved Reddit posts. It feels so cluttered. The biggest problem are my bookmarks and email. I have about 2500 saved bookmarks on my computer and maybe 25000 emails that need to be deleted. On my old computer I finally got fed up with it and deleted about 20000 saved bookmarks, and it felt so liberating but I don't know how to do that with Reddit posts or Youtube videos.

For anyone who's not a hoarder this is just a simple problem to solve, just don't save anything. But I can't help but click the save button as soon as I see something. I almost do it without thinking. Has anyone had this problem before? What do you suggest I do to be a digital minimalist? I have written down a plan to delete 50 bookmarks, 50 emails, and 20 reddit posts and youtube videos a day. But maybe I should just go completely nuke everything and get a fresh start?

nosurf,I miss being able to read books for hours,"When I was a kid I used to love reading books. I could read them for hours a day. I also enjoyed creative work. I had lots of creative ideas, I tried to make my own books, I did origami, I made a laptop from paper and thought of the simple games I could do on it (like writing some sequences as fast as I can on the keyboard I painted).

All of it was a lot of fun and excitement back in a day. I didn't even have a phone or a laptop but I was so much more fulfilled and happier. Now I'm a shell of the person I was before. I can't finish a single page of the book because of my lack of focus and boredom. I'm discouraged to do anything that takes more than a while to finish.

I tried to block my social media but I always fear that maybe I'll really need it sometime and I'm afraid to block it for good, and even 10 minutes a day don't help because for me it's like eating a single crisp, it's hard to finish on one and leaving it like this just leaves you more dissatisfied than before.

nosurf,How I went from phone addict to spending less than 1.5 hours on my phone (iOS),"Over the last couple weeks, I have seriously cut down on my phone usage. Here is a breakdown of what worked for me.

**Background**

The internet was my first real addiction. I didn't have too many friends growing up so I would spend hours on online games, YouTube and Facebook. I never signed up for Instagram that saved me from one demon but it's a game of whack-a-mole. When you avoid one slot machine, there is always another one that gets you. YouTube, Reddit and general doom scrolling are my vices. During my peak, would spend 6+ hours daily on these apps. 

**Why not switch to a dumb phone**

My smartphone is helpful is so many ways - 2 factor auth, QR codes at restaurants, FaceTime, maps, uber etc. It was not a feasible to completely get rid of it (for me). Also, I am a firm believer that the more you fervently avoid something, the more addiction builds around it. The opposite of love/crave isnt hate/disgust; It is apathy

**My Solution**

1. Delete all non-essential apps on your phone (including your browser). For an easy heuristic, go on screen-time and find any app that you spent more than 2 hours in the past week. This is a bad/addictive app that needs to go. 
2. You cannot delete Safari but you can block it. Here are the [instructions](https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/en_US/privacyhub/remove-safari/). 
3. This is the best part: If you really need to access a website, you can do it through the Gmail app by emailing yourself the link to open it. I can still open TikToks and Reddit threads that my friends send me this way. Once I am done, I just delete the email with the link. Want to check Instagram once? Send yourself a link. It will force you to log in every time. 
4. Sign up for email newsletters from internet writers (I like David Perrel, Sahil Bloom, and Not Boring by Packy McCormick). They provide interesting long-form content on various topics. If I am bored or want a quick distraction, the links in the email take me directly to the article. 
5. Find other activities to spend your time or even better, learn to do nothing. 

Step #3 will make it increasingly annoying to browse anything. However, you do have an outlet if you truly need to open a link or find a page. Since I do have an outlet, my brain cant come up with an excuse to re-download my browser again.

Even after you implement this plan, you will instinctively pick up your phone. Your mind will seek that sweet, sweet dopamine from scrolling. But now it won't get it anymore (my pickups doubled the week after). Soon your brain won't associate your phone with dopamine hits and you are relatively free from your addiction. Stay vigilant. Dont download your browser. 

**Why does this work?** 

Because you are actively designing a system that does the opposite of what every tech company does. You are actively adding friction and multiple steps to a process that was relatively simple.

**Disclaimers**

I have a laptop that I use for work/general internetting. However, I find that I dont waste as much time on it. It's also not easy to hold in bed and scroll. 

You can technically send yourself the link to [www.google.com](https://www.google.com) to cheat the system. I did that initally and still spent hours on my phone. Ultimately I was fooling myself into believing that was better. My new rule is no generic website links like google or youtube unless it is an absolute emergency to truly look up something.

nosurf,Going to Japan for a digital-detox vacation,"I am going to Japan for three months starting in March and I had the idea to partake in a digital detox during that time. I will be staying in an AirBnb in a small town with population under 50k. The apartment I'm renting does not have internet and only has an old CRT TV. I could actually try to live without any of the modern technology.

My plan is to not use my phone during that time and only keep it on incase of emergencies or something. With no internet, I was thinking of taking some old VHS movies I have in storage with me and watch those when bored. I can buy the local newspapers from store (I can read japanese enough to understand) and leaving my laptop home would totally limit my screen time. I even have an old Walkman cassette-player with me so I may just try to live like I was in the 80s.

Is there anything I should watch out for? Something that I should consider or things I should take with me? I think the vacation will really give me the much needed time to relax for a while.",2023-02-24 17:11:55,1677258715

nosurf,day 2 check in- anxiety,"I decided to reduce my internet usage since in the last weeks, it became too much and started affecting my life more negatively.

so, my strategy is now to not use IT for entertainment anymore since this is my maim problem. I will still be using it for work (mostly on the pc), uni (a lot of study material is online), language study (stuff like duolingo), contact with people, creative work (mostly writing but also photo editing) and self development (posting on here). maybe I will proceed with stronger rules in the future but for now, this is a good solution. 

I struggle with anxiety so whenever I take away a coping mechanism, my anxiety goes up. I definitely felt that yesterday already. luckily, I was busy all day and went out at night but in the evening I felt some random anxiety come up. also, I get the urge to scroll or watch videos whenever I'm doing anything on my phone. I definitely feel uncomfortable in reality without the cushion of online entertainment at the moment.

nosurf,quit social media whilst living abroad...how to not feel the urge to share,"I was a chronically online person my whole life. Grew up on the Internet. Specifically early days of youtube, forums, etc way before I should've been on those things. I have gone through lots of periods in my life without social media. I deleted it for nearly a year pre COVID and prior to that I've had months without it.

I am currently living abroad and my life could easily be 'instagrammable' and 'aesthetic.' I have become so disillusioned with social media. It has ruined my sense of self worth, heightened my anxiety and it felt so stupid to be looking at people's lives that I haven't spoken to in years. I went cold turkey and deleted all the apps about a month ago.

It's been fine and I've not felt any desire to return to it. I don't want to share things and post things but I'm going on some cool trips soon and keep thinking that I need to show people what I'm doing. I don't even know why I feel this way (I guess years of conditioning lol). How can I resist the urge to post things? I've found that taking pictures and sending them to my close friends has been a nice way to share what I'm doing. But the urge to update the world with where I am can feel hard to curb. It sounds ridiculous I know. But I've never been in this position before and I swore that I was never going to get the apps back. 

I hope this doesn't sound pretentious or obnoxious at all. I just want to be able to stay offline when the urge to post is strong lol.

I hate reddit, YouTube, or twitter, but they seem to be the only things I have when I get home. I don't even like most if the content I consume, its all looks the same now. Repelling even. 

Most of the content I've consumed since high-school has been very USA-centric. I don't know why but I'm sick of everything about America now. I haven't visited the reddit front page since a long time and I do feel better now. Its seems very artificial. This site is filled with whinny pricks.

nosurf,I need to stop relying on Reddit,"I use Reddit for a lot. If I want to buy a product or use a service, I look it up on Reddit to see what people are saying about it. I can get a bunch of different opinions, like a survey. 

- I use it for validation. Too much. If I’m feeling a certain way or think something, I’ll look it up on Reddit to see if someone else feels the same way as I do to make me feel less crazy. 

- I use it for emotional support. IRL I’m independent. I only have my Mom and my older sister. I love my Mom but she is very childlike. After the past few years with her and her mental instabilities, I have become less inclined to share things with her or confide in her but I’m working on that. My sister has too much on her plate and is not emotionally available like she used to be. And I have no partner or friends at all. So, what I do is write about how I feel and sent it out to the world anonymously, and will hear from people who feel the same way, or who offer comforting words, perspectives or advice to help me out. If I need to vent in general, Reddit’s always there. 

- I use it for general advice. And I have gotten some good pointers on here about weight gain, etc that I can’t really find in articles online.  

—————————————————————
Here’s the thing… I want to go back in time as much as I can. I want to go back to the days when I wasn’t reliant on my smartphone. I want to live now as if I lived in the 90s as much as I reasonably can. 

- In the 90s, you didn’t really research every product before you bought it. You heard word of mouth, or tried it and found out it sucked. It was trial and error.

- in the 90s, I imagine you just had to validate yourself or get that validation from friends.

- in the 90s, you had your friends for emotional support. You couldn’t rely on random people on the internet. 

I deactivated my Facebook already for like 2 weeks now and haven’t missed it at all. Haven’t even felt the urge to log in. But Reddit is going to be a lot harder since I’ve come to rely on it so much over the past few years. 

As an example… I’m here asking more strangers to encourage me to stop using Reddit. Lol. Please do.",2023-02-24 04:12:38,1677211958
nosurf,Wanting to create a good balance in life and be better,"(TW: mention of suicide and self harm)

Hello fellow nosurfers, first post here and I am glad to be reading everyone's posts in a long while. Brief note about myself--I'm a uni student in my early 20s, my academics were at a good pace, but that was not the issue. I hit a big rock bottom last year, realizing I got depressed from everything, wanting to apply self harm. But I pulled out and realized I needed to get help, and also I coped very hard with gym and surfing the internet everyday 24/7.  Thanks to my trusted circle of friends and a supportive network, I did better. 

But still life is hard and being at that age you think a lot about things and your life, I'm struggling too see how the internet will improve and it tends to get dangerous and on decline. I don't want to sound too doomer-ish because the internet does have its uses, but striking the right balance of using it is what needs to be done. I could rant about how I'm guilty of spending time on Reddit and Instagram a lot, especially going onto circlejerk subreddits like r/moviescirclejerk, r/dccomicscirclejerk and etc. It feels like it's all the same ""jerking"", Redditors cracking attempt after attempt at doing the same thing, because 90% of Reddit is a circlejerk, regardless of how big the subs are or aren't. And also it just feels like it's Facebook, trying to act intellectual but it's the whammy cringe that could be the same like 4chan. For Insta, it's moreso I watch reels and look up artists and stories, but I'm aware better self control in checking once a while, which feels ironic because I only spend 15 mins and open the app when I actually feel like it. 

So speaking of internet use, it's the way how I would read comics, but I'm super burnt out by it and have switched to reading actual books instead because they give a better feeling. I'm not saying comic books aren't good, but I don't have that many physical ones compared to actual books. Unrelated note too, but I'm super tired of comic book fans and movies, the culture around it is really toxic, just like Twitter mob mentality (which thankfully I don't use that or Tumblr as well), as well as too many things to read and catch up to--the last time I did read on a good pace was in 2017, and I'm super lost on that.

Until last week, I opened up my introverted self to a lot of newcomers/freshers who were at college, and I made a lot of friends. I did spend time on my phone/computer, but it got less because I realized socializing was very important, and people did approach me when I just became myself and not some online avatar, or some persona behind a mask like we all do on here. It makes us insecure. I even spent lesser time on Reddit and contributing a lot more on talking with actual people, and it feels good. I got some new girls to try an alcoholic beverage (which has been my favourite since my fresher year) which they never did, and got some new guys to join me at gym. I think it's been improving a lot for someone like me who was always socially awkward, and I even found myself having a crush on one of those girls as well--I've been single my whole life and never dated.

So what do you guys think about a good self improvement plan, that actually keeps a good balance between both? Because there's no way to quit internet use, and it would be a very hard withdrawal on everyone. Last year, I went out a lot myself, including going on a long train ride (both back and forth are two hours) while listening to my AirPods  and reading a book at the same time. This year, I learnt how to play chess. Just needed some actual physical stuff to do that doesn't always involve technology that could help us break out of our shells and to keep making more friends, because in turn it'll help more people as well.

(P.S. phone usage is still prominent for me, I still need to use it to text people, I use it past 12 AM, I call my cousin from across the globe almost every day.)",2023-02-24 01:22:56,1677201776
nosurf,How My Wristwatch Helped Me,"I've been trying many ways to count my minutes outside internet, and the only decent method that i've found is timing in my wristwatch. Basically i'll use the cronometer to count how much time i spend only doing chores, even chores that require internet such as reading an article or tutorial. I make a list containing all the chores of the week and try to check them as soon as i can. My average ""productive time"" is usually about 3-5 hours, which is enough to get a lot done for the day (i have a full-time job). It has really helped me, and so let me know what has helped you!

nosurf,It infuriates me just how much I care about shit that isn't real. (Or at least relevant to my life),"It only really struck me the other day just how fucking pointless a lot of this new generation shit is.

Time spent on socials, playing video games, watching porn, watching YouTube/Twitch for example. It's actually a just a straight up WASTE of time and energy. 

And the shittier thing is that it'll corrode your thoughts once you've spent enough time doing this for long enough. 

It was just the other day I realized I spend more time thinking about shit that isn't real/doesn't effect my life than I think about things that actually matter.

I'll go on long strings of thought about video games. I'll randomly think about shit I saw on reddit, instagram, or tiktok. I'll think about how YouTubers and Streamers are doing (Which really makes no sense since I don't know these people). I'll even pan out and picture porn scenes in my head. 

None of this shit is real. Yet I dedicate so much thought to it. As a result I'm not all that real. I suppose I've learned *some things* from spending so much time on the internet but I also have to ask **""would I have learned any less had I just put the phone down and lived out my life a little more?""** 

My bank account balance should be greater, and the list of contacts on my phone should be bigger. My relationships with those in my contacts should be better. I should be more stoic and disciplined. I should be physically stronger. I should have more practical skills. etc etc.

*Well...*

I suppose I learned ***something*** from all those educational YouTube videos, but I lack real life experiences. You don't get hired for your Vsauce understanding of mathematics. In fact you don't get ANYTHING. It's knowledge that you can't even use. You remember what you made fun of school for? ""Not teaching you practical skills."" Turns out you were even more efficient at that job.

I suppose I made some friends online... But they're thousands of miles away and offer nothing more for me than someone to play video games with. The friends I made in person? They simply went on without you, actually doing shit.

At least I'm pretty good at video games though! 

hahahaha HAHAHAHAHA. Cool bro, play for another 5000 hours and you might be able to compete professionally for less money than that of a McDonald's manager. 

Only now do I realize just how stupid this cycle is, and more importantly how deeply it's fucked me over so far.",2023-02-23 20:23:21,1677183801
nosurf,Back To Happiness - FREE Ebook,"To whom it may concern:

One morning, not too long ago, two executives of equal rank sat down to drink a cup of coffee before heading out to work. They were very similar. Both were still married, had two children, and lived in the same neighborhood. They had known each other since college and both had been working at the same company for several years.

One of them was getting a head start on the day. He was organizing his priorities, getting updated on the latest events, and communicating with his team.

The other watched a little tree as he appreciated his cup of fresh-brewed coffee. He would take a sip and enjoy how it would subtly wet his lips, caress his tongue, and continue flowing through his throat.

But that wasn’t the biggest difference.

Even though both had a day full of tasks ahead, one of them looked in a rush and had an expression of tiredness on his face. The other one looked awake, peaceful, and grateful.

**Have you ever asked yourself why some people seem happier than others?**

If stress, overwhelm, sadness, disagreement, fear, anger, anxiety… are part of life, the difference lies in our ability to go [back to happiness](https://www.amazon.com/Back-Happiness-David-Torres-Rodr%C3%ADguez-ebook/dp/B0BS9XLGGH) each time we move away from it.

nosurf,"Be honest, do you really believe there is a way out? (Just like an alcoholic CAN live without drinking) Can we live without scrolling? Is it possible?","The difference between alcohol addiction and internet addiction is the fact that internet addiction (like food addiction) is almost impossible to go cold turkey. 

Like food, we NEED the internet in this day and age, one way or another. More often, people need it for work and that unfortunately, is one of their triggers! It becomes too easy to start scrolling (when you are already on the internet for work etc) 

What *is* the answer? Really? 

Im starting to think this is a losing battle. 

Perhaps it's just the world we live in now. 

Have we lost? And technology has won? (Or at least the billionare creators have won) 

I think if there was truely a way out, we would all know the answer by now. 

But we get app after app. Some apps we actually RELY on (like I said for work) which makes it impossible to quit the internet.

nosurf,How do I do it?,"I’ve tried coming off the Internet and stopping all the addicting things I do on it (video games, porn) but for some reason I always feel. It has literally been 5 years like this. I’m coming to the age where I really should be moving out. I’ve been depressed because of how bad the Internet is for me. I dropped out of a very good University because I couldn’t get off the Internet and was too depressed to get out my room. Lost my friends, family thinks I’m a freak. I just can’t seem to stop. I’ve stopped smoking, can’t remember the last time I drank, I’ve tried Coke and went on a few nights with it but never really had a problem stopping. The internet, really. Out of all addictions I’ve had, the internet really is in its own Universe and it’s so embarrassing because it sounds so pathetic. I don’t know what to do, while I’m still living with my Mum it’s fairly her rules so that means Internet in the house. I’ve tried disconnecting from the Wi-Fi, getting my Mum to change the password so I can’t get on it but I always find a way, the Alexa echo we have I found out had a web browser, I watched Porn on that. So stupid. Even the TV, I’ll sneak downstairs to watch the Adult channels, I’ve even locked myself in handcuffs and leg cuffs to try and stop myself but nothing works. I’ve tried looking at places that are alternatives to a rehab, rehab can literally be thousands a day, which is ridiculous. I’ve debated going to Prison. I really don’t know what to do, I’m such a mess getting a job and saving up Money to move out seems very far away although most likely is what I’ll have to do to get out of this. Even then I thought University because of the change in environment would be the turning point but how wrong I was. What do I do? I’m powerless.",2023-02-23 18:38:59,1677177539
nosurf,Help with my plan to unwarp my brain? [Sorry for the slightly long post],"For context, I am 15 and also have autism and severe, almost OCD-like anxiety, which probably doesn't help my internet usage. My problem isn't with wasting time because I usually only spend about thirty minutes on things like TikTok unless I'm bored with class. I waste time but I'd rather waste time with stuff that doesn't make me anxious. My problem is that TikTok, Tumblr, and surfing Reddit has made me ""Chronically Online."" I'm CONSTANTLY worried about something stupid. Decided I don't feel like reading today? My brain says I'm a totally a boredfag, anti-intellectual, spergshit. I feel like going out with my friends to go to Hot Topic and buy stupid things and enjoy my teenage years? I'm a cringepilled unbased weebcuck who deserves to be gassed for enjoying American rock band My Chemical Romance. I hope you get the point.

The problem is less ""FOMO"" and more that I feel like I'm living a lie for not being exposed to political ideologies online 100 percent of the time. I am not far-right, I actually consider myself a leftist but with all the ""pilled"" talk online I feel like a coward that's living a lie and if I'm not thinking about exposing the lies or harassing people online I'm wasting my time. 

As you know I'm autistic and my ""special interest"" for years has been cartoons and animation. I've been to conventions before and have had a lot of fun in fandoms with art and fanfic and write my own fanfic that's finally 100k words which I'm very proud of. I have trouble making IRL friends because I'm very annoying and like weird things so that's why I'm always online. But ever since the ""Proshipper"" vs. ""Antishipper"" argument took off, stupid chronically online shit has been literally raising my blood pressure. Like I can literally feel myself getting lightheaded. I just want to enjoy fanfic without being a ""problematic fancop"" for thinking Invader Zim diaper kink fanfic is kind of weird and maybe people should make better uses of their time and if people want to have a diaper kink at least don't involve kids in it. But both pros and ""antis"" are EXTREMELY hostile to themselves, each other, and even people like me who don't want to be involved. 

But what made me realize I need to get offline is my horrifying intrusive thoughts. Naturally people like talking about really gross things online, and unfortunately I first discovered porn when I was eight on my Kindle Fire. It wasn't normal vanilla stuff either, it was generally really depraved: real life actual bestiality, BDSM ""BillDip"" fanfic, loli/shota, incest, gory FNAF r34. Sorry you had to read those gross words. :(. Overall this really warped my perception of things and now my brain is permanently cursed with having horrible sexual intrusive thoughts about the kids things I use to cope. I get more desensitized to them every time and now I can look at really gross things unflinchingly and I just want to be normal again and have a semi-normal brain again. I do not know how to undo that. Spending SO MUCH time online is actively sucking my sense of empathy.

But plan is to delete TikTok and Tumblr, and not access the front page of Reddit. That's the first step. The next step is to organize my room so it's not a hellhole and every time I get the urge to use TikTok, I call up my few friends to do fun things with them like watch movies, listen to my record player, play games, go to the mall or maybe Chili's, etc. That way I'm talking to real life people instead arguing with weirdos online that don't like me anyway.

So it was that that made me realize I probably need to unwarp my brain but I've run into some complications that I need help with.

1. I listen to things while I work such as YouTube or Podcasts, but I don't know if it counts as ""surfing.""

I don't know whether to cut off YouTube, or just stop watching videos about silly drama. The only thing I really use YouTube for is to listen to video essays. I like making jewelry and such and if I'm not listening to Spotify to help me concentrate (I do not like bird sounds, silence sounds, or the air conditioner sounds) I'm listening to a Podcast about shows I like or wierd niche YouTube video essays. The video essays I like are Iceberg videos, show analysis, stuff about my ""special interests"" (being animation and pagan religions) and I listen to those while drawing or doing crafts. I'm trying not to watch ""drama"" videos anymore but how do I manage healthy YouTube use? 

2.  My schoolwork makes me too tired to do ""wholesome"" or ""mindful"" activities sometimes.

I try to do healthy things like meditate, I go on walks on Saturdays, I play with my dogs, etc. But I am very fatigued from schoolwork at times. I would like to be more productive but the time I spend on TikTok I wouldn't have the energy to do something cool anyway. Sometimes I don't even feel like I have the energy to do things I enjoy anyway that take no effort like watching TV. I enjoy meditation, language learning, reading, discovering new bands, giving back to my community, learning about ancient mythologies but I'm SO TIRED!!! My brain already has to remember algebra let alone cool things. :(. If I'm gonna waste time, I at least want to do it in a way that doesn't stress me out.

   3. I want to post my art to Reddit and talk about my hobbies.

I'm sure the whole art and hobbies thing has beaten into the ground on this sub so you know the drill: I have hobbies and still want to see them online without giving in to the mindless drama and anxiety of social media. Tips?

nosurf,Tech bros and nihilism,"I was talking to one of my friends about being depressed and angry over AI being created to replace writers, artists, and other creative types(On the Alexa I even saw, can AI cook better then humans).We were talking about how freaking nihilistic tech obsessed people are.  They really seem to actually WANT  people to be completely expendable and  seem to weirdly think that people  want a world where humans are nothing more then constant consumers wanting to be entertained.  

People that actually love and appreciate technology though aren't like this.   I actually really love computers.   I used to love building computers with my dad, and using the computer to write and play games.   I also think cameras(real cameras, not phone cameras) are completely amazing.   I took a photography class recently and loved learning how to do both digital and film photos.   Film was especially great, because we used the darkroom!


What technology do you actually like and appreciate?   What old school technology do you really miss and wish would come back?",2023-02-23 15:51:51,1677167511
nosurf,How to no surf when work gets in the way?,"Hi no surf! So I’ve been on my social-media free journey for a couple years, but I still have some major hurdles. YouTube, surfing Reddit, and news/educational content are my vices. I often justify YouTube and Reddit as well with the premise that I’m mostly watching content that’s hobby related. However, I should be better about going to do my hobbies rather than watching other people do them online... 

One major roadblock I’m hitting is that I am expected to be reachable via call, text or email 7 days a week for my job. I don’t have to reply on my days off, but I am expected to stay engaged and respond to any urgent matters. My job does not provide computers so I am expected to use personal devices for this. Additionally, as I work in the arts, social media content/creation is a big part of how we market, and it is stressful to have a work social media presence when I don’t have a personal one. This makes it very hard to stay offline, as I’m often on edge about the work-related emails flooding my inbox, and posts on social media. Any advice on work/home no surf boundaries?",2023-02-23 12:08:19,1677154099

nosurf,I have an addictive personality.,"I've used (and debatably abused) several substances over the years: Caffeine, Alcohol, Nicotine, THC, Amphetamine and a few other. I obsessed over board games, video games and varies froms of media (some SFW, some not), but I always managed to catch the moment when things got out of hand and stopped. Right now in fact I'm on my yearly sobriety month and it's working quite well. 

Thank god I was always bored of gambling, otherwise I'd be a broke and broken man. But there's one slot machine I just can't stop using: the internet and especially (para)social media. Endlessly scrolling through feeds in hopes of getting to a post that showers you in dopamine. Leaving comments and arguing with strangers in the hopes of seeing numbers go up for no particular reason.

I used to scoff at people who smoked thier first cigarette immediately after getting out bed. Today I can barely get out of bed without picking up my smartphone and staring into the bright colors for a few minutes. It's my most persistent, physically and psychologically damaging addiction. 

I've thought about this for a while and compiled a list a reasons why that's the case:
1. *Availability.* I (like most people) carry my phone around in my pocket. Always less than ten seconds away from using it. To make matters worse I work in IT. I have to use the internet constantly. Most drugs require at least a little amount of preparation, a few steps to contemplate if you're actually up for consumption. Scrolling through your phone can be done anywhere for any amount of time and only requires the tiniest amount of muscle memory. 
2. *Time delta between usage and effect.* Drugs tend to be more addictive the more immediate thier effect is. That's one of the reasons it's advised to swollow drugs like Speed instead of snorting them. It creates a more linear, mellow high and that's exactly the opposite of what we do with phones. We consume short form content, that is instantly rewarding, often lacking the sustained focus to enjoy anything else. That's why you see people struggling to follow a TV series, scrolling through thier slot machine of choice 
3. *Lack of a social stigma.* This is quite a new phenomenon, at least in its intensity. Smart phones were around when I went to school and by god, we didn't use them responsibly, but it wasn't nearly as bad as it is now. Most people I know from every age bracket have at least a  questionable relationship with thier usage and we as a society have somehow accepted that.

I started to physically distance myself from my phone. I put it on shelf when I'm at home or deep into my backpack when I'm outside, reducing the availability whenever possible. It's a very freeing experience, but it's hard. I constantly catch myself searching for it and when I actually need to use it, I lose track of what I actually wanted to do as soon as I unlock the screen. It's crazy.",2023-02-23 11:13:46,1677150826
nosurf,15 hours daily screen time //tips?,"I’m in such a deep addiction with my phone I can’t come off of it!! I keep saying okay today I’m gonna take a step back but nope I can’t bring myself to do it! My worst enemy is tiktok.. it’s so addicting and like I can’t come off of it, like I hate and love tiktok because sometimes tiktok has really interesting and educational videos and then all the others are just things I don’t really need to consume.

Then there’s the other thing which is I have a fear of missing out! But am I really missing out on much? Idk. I always check Twitter for news and ahh I literally feel like my brain is fried from consuming so much social media on a daily basis like I’m only 21 and I don’t feel like I’m living at all!

And then there’s the “what do I do without my phone” I have tried to get into other hobbies and I do for abit and then as soon as I’m done I just sit there bored like well now what? Then I can’t help but go on my phone.

Does anyone have this problem? Anyone have tips? it would be highly appreciated",2023-02-23 05:28:05,1677130085
nosurf,Just wanting to get something off of my chest.,"If you're one of those people who is prone to using terms like ""pity party"" you might not want to read this.

For years I have tried everything under the sun: using blocking apps, day on/ day off method, lock boxes, time locks, smashing phones and computers, support groups. So far, I haven't convinced anyone to lock me up a la Black Snake Moan(but with internet addiction, not nymphomania). A few minutes ago, for the third time in a month I tore into a locked tool box so I could get my modem. The fact is as long as the internet is out there, I will find a way to get to it. 

The bottom line I don't quit because I don't want to. When I'm alone, I turn to the internet for company or even when times are good, to keep the high I turn to the internet. Oh, I make up some excuse like ""I better get online to search this issue I'm having with my car""(I never even look it up. I head straight to porn, reddit or some stupid Youtube video.)

Forget about hacks like greyscaling and getting rid of images. This issue will not go away until my fear of the future outweighs my desire for a fix. Much like
 a drug junkie knows what he is doing is wrong in the longterm sense but does it anyway because there is nothing better he can find for getting out of the hell he's in right now, I can't find anything better for me right now other than getting online. I am again alone, it is night, my house is quiet. What am I supposed to do? Look at a wall? Fuck books, they're boring. I don't have any friends that I can call. This is all that I can find. 

I want to apologize to my younger self and nature or whatever put me here for wasting 40 years on television and later, internet. I could've done something but I did nothing.",2023-02-23 04:35:35,1677126935
nosurf,"Advice for fighting ""relapses"" during particularly low points?","Been at this a little over a month, and really need some words of encouragement or advice. Thanks ahead of time as I may not respond with my current energy levels. 

  I've really had some success. I'm pretty disillusioned to tiktok and twitter now (which were my biggest time wasters). Tiktok was pretty easy, I think I was getting a little bored of it anyway, and I haven't even really thought about it. But getting on Twitter less has been a rollercoaster for me. 

You see, I've been on it for years for different communities. At my peak of addiction I was on the app/site 8+ hours a day. No joke. My breaking point was in Jan when I just spent an entire day feeling terrible over something stupid on there, which has happened many times, but that night I found out I really have an issue *issue* that went beyond ""lol i have too much screentime"". 

I've reduced my time greatly on it. I think only around an hour one week. As I said I've become disillusioned. I had quite a bit of time this month where I was pretty fine without it besides the occasional urge. But, over the past week I've found myself getting really bothered thinking about things that have happened to me on the app and discourse on there. It's really fucking unhealthy. 

The past 2 or so days have been utter hell with it, as I've been at a lowpoint from something IRL that happened. The urge is so bad to scroll on there. I spent around 45 minutes straight without realizing it this afternoon. I installed a blocker yesterday for it, but today I just kept taking it off and getting back on robotically. This is of course despite knowing it makes me feel 100x worse to be on there and especially to actively read the discourse, the drama of the week, the story of the newest cancelled person, etc. 

I agree with the notion that the best way to actually make your goals here is actually having hobbies/talking to friends/going out etc instead of just cold turkeying it and not making any real changes. I've picked up several new things, and have been progressing with stuff I haven't in years. I have short term and long term goals. But I'm just unmotivated as hell right now. I know that is a whole other (but heavily correlated) issue though, which is why I simply want advice to at the very least NOT go to social media while I'm bringing my motivation back up.

(PS ...ive been reluctant to deactivate but also don't want to spend time trying to fix the hell that is my timeline. i already have a priv but it doesn't help much as i may just end up spending more time tweeting every little thought, or go searching for the fights using keywords anyway. honest opinions on that needed too.)",2023-02-23 03:31:39,1677123099
nosurf,Turned my Smartphone into a fancy Dumbphone,"Thanks to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/11108x9/cure_your_phone_addiction_in_10_minutes/) post from u/Wild_Scallion_7307 I was able to delete a bunch of crap off my phone and kick the scroll for a few days. I'm so happy I figured how to do this, I don't know anything technical about phones but it was pretty simple, minus a couple hurdles. 

I have yet to delete YouTube and that one is going to be hard but I'll do it eventually because having something constantly playing in the background is not good for my mind. I need stillness. 

The title of this post is misleading (AKA a lie) because my phone is far from a dumbphone - in fact, instead of just keeping Maps and Spotify and Whatsapp etc, I also downloaded some educational and creative type apps. So now if I have the desire to scroll or use my phone I will end up reading something on the Wikipedia App, or browsing History Timeline, or reading an article from an email newsletter I have subscribed to. 

One step towards seeing my phone as a tool, instead of entertainment/distraction.

The internet makes the world infinite - think about Bo Burnham's song ""Welcome To The Internet"".

""Would you like a bit of everything, all of the time?""

It's up to us to shrink our worlds a little bit.

nosurf,Trying not to go back to Instagram or Discord,"I’ve managed to let go of most social media except YouTube and Reddit. Though I am much more mindful of how I use YouTube and I know eventually I will to say goodbye to Reddit. 

Instagram and Discord have been the most addictive for me and hardest to let go. 

I only have a few more days to wait before my Discord account is permanently deleted. That one is a little easier to let go of though it took me a while to get to this point. When I went back and just observed, I realized how much is said with very little substance. Nobody can really have real conversations for fear of going against the echo chamber and I realize how boring and superficial it really is. 

Instagram has been harder to let go of as it has been a process of back and forth for about three years. I think I finally am at about an eight out of ten for not wanting to go back. I realize how it is just filled with vanity and people trying to sell crap I don’t need. I have about a week and half to wait out before my Instagram is permanently deleted.

Deleting the accounts are tough but it’s hard to get through the waiting period they put you in case you change your mind. I do okay with keeping myself busy with other things but I almost caved with Instagram today. I just have to remind myself that I am almost at the finish line and I don’t want to have to wait another thirty days.

nosurf,We develop interests online rather than in the real world.,"Something to think about. We wonder why we can’t relate to anybody in the real world. Well it’s because everything you are interested in is because you developed that interest while being online. Which then makes you feel disconnected from the people around. Start listening to the interest of that actual people on your life. What are they into? Start learning about those things. 

It’s funny because I live in Canada and hockey is huge here but growing up I mainly focused on basketball which I basically only talked to people online about it. Once I started actually watching hockey and learning the game more and learning the players I started connecting more to the people in my life. So many people I know are into hockey and almost nobody is into basketball.

Now I’m not saying to just do what everyone else is doing and I’m also not saying to drop your current interests. All I’m saying consider exploring the interests of the people around you. You might find a new interest or hobby that can connect you to them.

It seems like whenever there is a lull in conversation, or a quiet moment, he’ll start checking Reddit. He is very active, and posts a lot on threads that have to do with his interests. 

Honestly it mostly bothers me when we are on the couch in the evening trying to watch a show or movie. I’ve tried explaining to him that when he’s on his phone a lot, it makes me think he’s not paying attention, and that we’re not really watching together. His response is usually “I can do two things at once.” Also, him being on his phone influences me to pull out my phone as well. 

So how can I say that this is a little more important to me than he thinks? Has anyone had success with having a partner cut their their screen time at least a little bit?",2023-02-22 14:03:58,1677074638

I think its rude if people are texting when we are hanging out so I don’t do that, but I feel like almost everyone disagrees with that. And not only is it rude, I don’t want to get out of the moment of whatever it is that I’m doing with whoever I’m with. Like “oh let me pause my evening for a minute to text back” it’s like it just takes you out of living your life and living in the moment.

nosurf,I decided to throw in the towel,"At 5th grade elementary school (10 years old) I got addicted to the internet. Internet and social media provided me an escape from the negative feelings that I've felt and it opened the door for me to a whole different reality. At first it was subtle, I played offline games that my mom downloaded for me for a few hours per day and that was it. 

Then came social media, online gaming, Twitch streaming etc... This consumed me. I started playing games, browsing the internet, scrolling social media for 8-12 hours per day. I got addicted to porn, saw things that I shouldn't have, learned things that I shouldn't have etc... When I wasn't on my computer I've spent my time zoning out on the phone. The escapism that the internet offered me slowly became my reality. I got so absorbed into the internet that it was my entire existance. 

My grades fell, sleep schedule got so screwed that I've in a lot of cases slept only for a few hours per night, friendships that I maintained became weird, was extremely anxious all the time and got severely depressed. I recently looked at the chat messages with my friends from way back in the day and it is very very clear where the shift happened. When I was reading the texts I cried my balls out. You could see the suffering, anxiety and depression in the texts themselves due to the effects of internet addiction. I wasn't myself anymore and my mind wasn't present in reality anymore. 

From that day onward I had no friends, no social life, no academic success and no real life experiences. The only thing I had was my computer. It replaced all of social development and my entire reality. Now I'm 21 years old. For some reason with the help of weed I somehow managed to break out of the bubble in which I've spent for the last 12 years and I realized what I've done. I realized that all the ""online"" socialization that I've done with streamers, forums, communities is all a giant illusion. I realized that my brain and social development pretty much stopped the moment I got this addiction. I realized how fucking lonely I truly am where as before my mind got tricked by the internet that I'm constantly among other people... 

When I broke out of this illusion I felt like I'm still emotionally and mentally in elementary school. It sounds weird, but I miss those friends or at least the feeling of having those friends so fucking much. Now that I think about it, those elementary school friends were the only real substantial people that I had in my life apart from my parents. Its so damn sad that half of my life is now a giant blur. I thought that I could salvage it, I truly did. I tried hanging out with people, tried getting a job, tried joining clubs, but its clear that I'm waaaaaay behind other people in terms of social development. People regard me as a freak, moron or straight up autistic person and I don't blame them. Who would want to be a friend with a person that practically blacked out on 50%-60% of his life.

As I age things will only get worse and worse. People will start families and business while I will still be decades behind trying to catch up. I have a giant black hole in the place where REAL elementary and middle school experiences should be not this online bullshit. What I need is to turn back time to 5th grade, throw my computer out the window and press the play button. I crave those experiences so much and I will NEVER be able to authentically have them. From now on what waits for me is adult life full of responsibilites, 8 hour shifts, constant moments where people will shit talk me for my socialization, panic attacks/depression etc... 

The hole just seems to deep. No amount of neuroplasticity, pills or real life can fix this now and it is definitely not a life worth living. I've ordered a rope from Amazon and will most likely end it in March. This will be my first and last post on this throwaway since I only wanted to share my experiences with parents and young people on this sub. Please go live your life in the real world. Online world DOES NOT matter. I cant remember a single positive thing that stuck with from being online all those thousands of hours, but I can remember a lot of feelings and moments from elementary school, and that was 12 YEARS AGO!! Real experiences and relationships build your character and make this life worth living. To parents, limit your kids internet use to a few hours per day or read up on some articles on how much time a kid should be spending online according to the age. If you let them spend a lot of time online I can't even imagine the damage todays apps and algorithms can inflict on a young mind.

nosurf,Quitting Twitter a year ago was one of the best decisions I've made,"I spent an insane amount of time on twitter from the age of 13 up until I was around 18. I'm talking hours and hours every day... anywhere from 4-8+ hours. Every single day. During such formative years of my life. So much of this time was spent absorbing negative content - nasty, mean spirited tweets, politics, and constant arguments. Anything that could possible be made into an argument, was - this was just the way Twitter worked in the fandom circles I ran in, and it became my normal.

I met my current partner when I was 18, and my time spent on Twitter went down drastically, until I eventually quit when I was 20. I'm turning 22 this year, and I haven't looked back. I would check it every now and then to see funny tweets my friends had sent me, and sometimes would scroll for 10 or 20 minutes to see what was going on on my timeline. It was always horrible, negative stuff, and it was shocking to me. I couldn't believe I subjected myself to hours of this every day. Even consuming that content for a few minutes made me feel horrible. 

The thing that finally cemented that Twitter was truly terrible, was when someone I followed had retweeted or liked a tweet claiming that interracial relationships were morally wrong, and that black people should only date other black people. As someone in an interracial relationship with a black person, I felt so disgusted. That supposedly anti-racist, 'leftist' people would circulate this kind of content because it was worded in a 'woke' way, appalled me. It made me realise something I had been suspecting for a long time - that the people I had been following and consuming the tweets of for years never truly cared about bigotry, oppression, or other people. They don't even think for themselves enough to realise something they're retweeting is outwardly racist. They just parrot whatever is popular, and anything that doesn't comply to their exact point is shutdown.

I'm so glad I no longer have this mindset and that I'm free from an addiction to what I personally believe to be the worst, most toxic social media site. I think most people would massively benefit from limited their Twitter usage, or deleting it all together. Considering I spent almost my entire teenage years on Twitter, I haven't missed it for a second. It is a cesspool of negative garbage. Even if you only follow friends, you still get negative trending tweets pushed onto you constantly. I feel myself becoming more open minded every day. I'm reading a leftist political book currently, and finding myself disagreeing with quite a bit of it - and it feels so freeing. I don't have to agree with someone on everything. People can and \*will\* have differing opinions, and that's okay. It is so freeing!",2023-02-22 00:21:05,1677025265

I call it the AIR method, and it's been a while since it's been shared on here so this is for those who haven't seen it yet!","AIR stands for ""Accumulative, Incremental, Rewiring"". It's designed as a series of incredibly small baby steps. I wrote it with burned out, overwhelmed, low-dopamine people in mind. My hope is that it never feels feel like ""work"".

[Link to Introduction](https://staygrounded.substack.com/p/how-i-got-my-phone-screen-time-under-21-11-09)

[Link to outline/roadmap](https://staygrounded.substack.com/p/the-air-method-outline)

The idea is to not over-exert yourself, don't rely on willpower and let your brain slowly heal. First, make your device as non-intrusive as possible. Then gently coax your brain over a long period to re-learn how to come up with it's own entertainment (like it did in the ""before times""). 

I wrote this because when I looked for help, I found a lot of of listicles (and posts in nosurf) that gave good *bits* advice, but honestly just not a complete picture. Suggestions like ""delete apps from your homescreen"" are smart, but it's like telling a heroin addict to keep their spoons in the back of the drawer. It's only one tiny piece of the puzzle. 

I've been putting this out in phases over the last year (because this is *not* instant gratification), the first four are out already with Phase five coming soon. It's a newsletter format so you can subscribe as they come out.

I really hope this helps some people as much as r/nosurf has helped me. I'll be checking in on this thread if anyone has questions/comments!",2023-02-21 16:19:44,1676996384

nosurf,The smallest of small wins.,"I've long known that I spend a lot of time on the internet but last week was the first time I actually admitted to myself that actually addicted to it and that perhaps I should treat it as an actual addiction. I'm ashamed of myself. I am a 50-something woman, I'm very introverted and prefer my own company. For people like me, the internet can be a godsend but lately I've realised that I AM actually spending my life on the internet or connected to a screen in one way or another.

I come home from work, tired and wanting to shut the world out and as soon as I get in, I reach for my laptop and go the kitchen to prepare food - not without something to watch on Youtube though! 

I don't have any social media accounts apart from Reddit and I spend a lot of time here because it's SOO interesting and there are so many viewpoints and useful information. It's never boring.

I think I spend 90% of my time on Youtube or Reddit. 

I used to set one day a week where I would plan on doing nothing but surfing, listening to music, eating my favourite snack and doing nothing but chill out but over the past year or so, every evening has seen me doing 'nothing'. Nothing but surfing the internet. I am ashamed that my attention span has been completely destroyed. I watch things on Youtube with a pop-out screen whilst surfing other areas of the 'net. It's bad. 

On Sunday, I decided to actually and physically take action and that my laptop would remain in the place I put it when I go out, for the rest of the week. If I can get past this week, I'm hoping things will be easier.

I need to do this detox. I need to take action. I feel as though I'm at a point where things MUST change! I want my life back. 

Yesterday was day one. I came home from work, prepared my food whilst listening to my audiobook. I put some music on and then...didn't know what to do. I picked up a book, read a little, I looked out of the window, then I decided to measure my living room for some furniture that I want to purchase. I realised that I normally leave all my 'work' to the weekends so I can have my 'do nothing' evenings. 

Last night was enjoyable but still made me antsy. Every thought I had or question/query that popped into my head would normally send me to the internet to get immediate answers but I want to get used to not rushing to the 'net to get instant gratification.

It's a small win but any foot in the progress in the direction is okay with me.

nosurf,"There is nothing wrong with preferring older technology, wanting human interaction, and liking to do things manually.","I am really tired of feeling like I am the only one that really hates how completely tech obsessed society has become.  Lately, I have been going out of my way to cut down on technology use and I have become a lot happier and less anxious.   I love not having to rely on a GPS to get me everywhere,  going to the library to study using physical books is fun and I feel like I actually learn.   I love taking classes in person because you have real interaction.   It is also actually rewarding to get chores done and not just spend your time completely idle.  
  
The reaction of other people though is incredibly disappointing.  Apparently not wanting anything to do with apps, QR codes, and other annoying things means that you are going to be left behind because most people love having not to handle physical things or deal with people.  I don't understand why being obsessed with speed, efficiency and convenience is a good thing.  Frankly,  I like to actually take things slow and not be super rushed.

Most people live this reality but they never thought maybe for q second that there might be something wrong with it.

A lot of people actually never heard the term dopamine fasting.
They don’t realize that their brains are bored and they are feeding their brain with junk information fours hours during the day.

Every time the brain looks for a notification and it finds it it releases dopamine. 
They literally domesticated our brains.
To scroll down in the vastness of social media, feeding our brains, until a point where it becomes dependent of it.

Let’s be real? How many people could live nowadays a week without any device?
It is an alien ideia for a lot of people. I’ve heard a lot of them saying “I’d never be able to do that” like, what? This is not a normal answer and these people actually need help.

I spent the whole day today on my phone.
Always finding excuses to explain why it was okay to scroll down on Instagram for hours looking for things about a reality show.

I’m very aware that I use these to distract myself from the things that I really want to do.

The pornographic websites, I’ve lost track of how many times I’ve tried to quit.
But I always end up going right back at them.

My desires are stronger than my will power.
And I believe that that was the plan.
I’ve seen so many people advocating on  how we should talk more about ethics applied to tech companies, and the way that they are using tools to make it addictive to us.

This information is being hidden from people.
It is everybody’s interests to make people more and more addicted to the latest news, to celebrities and their songs, to the latest releases.

We’re being puppets in their hands.

And just a few number of people are talking about that on the internet.
Governments, people in position of power, they’ll never talk about that, because their fame is part of this so-called lie that we live in.

It is time to wake up people, and do what needs to be done. Cut the strings above your head.

How long are you still being their prisoners?

Remember, you can use technology in a way that was never taught.
With discipline and maturity.

Ask yourself, who is using technology? You old wise self? Or instead your younger lazy ass one that only wants to play games, see videos, and be entertained? 

How long will you continue to distract yourself?

Can’t you see you are trading literally your life for the minimum effort pleasure that you can have and that adds less to your life than any other?

Good about staying offline at work but tend to get home late and the internet - this website, YouTube, tik tok are tempting to just unwind a bit but I always end up staying online longer than I mean to and am tired the next day.  I'm trying to minimize or eliminate late night internet browsing.

Many of the suggestions on the activities list are great but I am often too tired to motivate myself to read a novel or self-help book or start some kind of creative project at the end of the long work day.

I do exercise 3-4 days a week but usually first thing in the morning.  If I wait until the evening I am often too tired.

I'm married but sometimes I work late and my wife is asleep when I get home so tempting to go online as I have no one to talk to.

I’ve been doing better on those, but most recently YouTube is my vice.

I wake up every morning around 6 am, just out of habit, and what do I do? I shower, watch YouTube, make breakfast, watch YouTube, make my lunch for work, watch YouTube, then watch YouTube until I leave for work, stare at a screen from 8:30-4:30 and then go home and watch YouTube until I go to bed and repeat it all again.

I’m sick of that. I have so many goals and things I can do instead of that, here’s my list below of what I can achieve if I just don’t waste my time anymore:

Get up and go for a run, shower, meditate, eat and go to work.

Go to the gym in the mornings before work or in the evening after work, get my ideal body I’ve been trying to achieve!

Spend more time with friends and my family, presently and not half assed waiting to get back to my phone. 

Finally run a marathon, train for it and then achieve a physical goal.

nosurf,Need to quit the internet.,"Recently in my life I've been developing something of a habit. Dunno what to call it, but I'm just attracted to stuff which I rationally know is just not going to feel any good to bother with. Just really inane crap - Youtube videos about the ""culture war"" on video games and how entertainment is being watered down for the ""normies"" and discourse on a certain video game series and whether it's been ""casualized"" have been two general foci recently. And I keep coming back to them, without fail, because they make me feel anxious and just not good in general - but somehow I'm just drawn back in again, like a moth to the flame, hooked on that feeling somehow.

And I had a moment of self awareness just now - maybe these are problems but is this really what I choose to spend my time caring about? Granted this came about because there's so little going on in my life, but it's utterly ridiculous to think about. How privileged am I that I actively decide to scroll threads full of opinions that I don't agree with, watch videos that make me feel worse, and probably make my hair go prematurely gray in the process?

By the age of 9 I was reading my father's books. A month before my 13th birthday I finished the longest book I've ever read - over 700 pages. Nowadays I hardly read anything except Reddit threads and Youtube comments about things that I really ought not to give a fig about, and this is the result.

However, I have an 8 year old boy and he is seriously limited on screen time. 30 min on Saturday and Sunday unless he earns more.  But then when he talks to his friends and all they want to talk about is what video games they are playing he tells them ""I'm not really allowed to play video games.""  Then I begin to worry about him being the ""weird kid""  I have recently begun reading how ""Oh now video games really are good for kids"" and how they ""increase grey matter""    


My son misses out a lot because he can't call his friends like we did on the land line when we were kids, the kids all contact each other through video games and social media.    


The thing is my kid LOVES baseball.  It's his favorite sport. And he is Damm'd good at it (plays an age level up and at a AAA level).  If he decided, he wanted to take up archery over baseball I would walk to the nearest sporting goods store and buy all the gear and buy all the classes. I don't care what he does but what I worry about is video games taking over priority of it.

In the first month, I did some good reflection on what needs I'm attempting to fill with my social media use and what my goals are for satiating those needs in more wholesome ways.

When I first got it, this annoyed me cos I thought I was getting a 2nd hand smart phone but I've got used to it and now I'm glad about the 'level' it's at - Whatsapp is free in my house so no wasting money on texts but the freedom to be without the internet when I leave the house cos I don't carry my tablet/laptop &amp; my phone lacks internet.

I have only got family &amp; friends who care about me on it. Everyone has been told the situation.

My dad still sends me (presumably) facebook memes via it (facebook.com/abunchoflettersandnumbers). Which don't load. Because there is only enough internet for the app itself.

I tell him this in two ways. I've tried being polite. I've tried being blunt. He still does it, whichever approach I try.

He's getting on my nerves at this point.

I'm also NOT ON FACEBOOK and you have to log in to access facebook! 

Feels like he's pressurising me to use the net more &amp; use Facebook in particular just so he can send me stupid jokes which he could have explained to me regardless.

I've not had FB since the 00s. Since Cambridge Analytica. Me and him were never FB friends. It's getting on my nerves that he's doing this.",2023-02-18 20:32:46,1676752366

nosurf,"Why you procrastinate on social media, and how to stop","I am currently writing my thesis on social media addiction, and found a paper on reducing procrastination from social media. I found one section incredibly useful in highlighting some of my behaviors around social media and changing them, and I think it can help others as well. Here it is:

Main causes of social media induced procrastination - according to the paper:

* **Poor expectation management,** coming from beliefs like “my friends expect me to reply almost instantly, no matter the time”.
* **Impulsiveness and lack of self control.** For example, having to check you phone as soon as you receiving a notification.
* **Poor time management.**
* **Habitual checking,** i.e. social media purely out of habit, for example as the first thing you do in the morning. This behavior has increasingly been normalized.
* **Social norms**, e.g. believing that procrastinating with social media is a ok because “everybody else does it”.

And here are some practices that can help you reduce social media induced procrastination:

* **Avoid getting overly affected emotionally by what you see online**. A large percentage of what you see online is not a reflection of the real world. The information on social media is filtered to maximize your engagement.
* **Accept to be imperfect:** Be ok that you might not always reply to a message as soon as people would like, accept that you cannot please everyone
* **Manage expectations:** You can manage your family / friends’ expectations by telling them when you are free to interact with them on social media, and when you are busy.
* **Positive thinking:** for example, if you had sent a message to someone and found that they had read your message but hadn’t yet replied, instead of obsessing over it you could choose to think more positively about the situation; they might have been busy at the time and needed more time to reply. Methods like this also help you develop more understanding and empathy towards others, and help you distance yourself from situations that might otherwise cause you anxiety.

**NOTE**: This post is part of a series of posts around problematic social media usage, and its interventions. I am currently writing my MSc thesis on it, and publishing my findings on reddit and my website.",2023-02-18 17:40:51,1676742051

Face to face life updates are better than seeing daily online updates. You get to hear the big things from your friends directly first and it's a different feeling than being updated on posts and giving them a like or comment online.

I wonder if I am undiagnosed ADHD, even though I read that this mostly affects younger people and rarely adults.

One day a friend of ours brought her ADHD kid for a game night, and I watched as her kid slowly started losing control of his body and behavior as the game went on. He basically could not sit still for a second in the end. 

I definitely don't have that issue, and I don't remember myself having that issue as a kid, maybe very rarely I would do some impulsive things like randomly getting up to write stuff on the blackboard in 1st grade, but that behavior went away quickly.

Is there a way to tell, or do I have to go see a specialist?",2023-02-18 15:13:43,1676733223
nosurf,I create alts to help me with more privacy and anonymity. Mainly using Reddit as a Q&amp;A/knowledge gathering tool. But subreddits treat new users commenting/posting as people who need to participate more.,"I use Reddit to confirm things that relate to my real life. For example, any event/place related to my city, I use the city subreddit. Any kind of question that's related to real life, I ask that. I first make sure that I don't ask that question so I try to search it within that subreddit using the search box. I also maintain several alts as I know to it's better to discuss something sensitive, avoid less profiling/stalking by users and reddit tools by 3rd party developers that enable stalking. When I create new accounts, I'm supposed to keep participating in that subreddit to acquire subreddit karma, so once I reach a karma threshold (comment-wise) my posts get approved much faster. This is what the problem is, being forced to use one account where the participation is higher. I hate this forced participation just to have my posts/comments visible asking questions related to real-life. In the subreddit I participate through my alts, my comments take up to a day to appear and posts are immediately removed and stay removed until I beg the moderator to reinstate it or it stays like removed forever if I do nothing, just because I'm a relatively new account.

These are the messages I get on the post page:

&gt; Sorry, this post has been removed by the moderators of r/heavilymoderatedsubredditwhereIaskedAsensiblenonbaityquestion Moderators remove posts from feeds for a variety of reasons, including keeping communities safe, civil, and true to their purpose.
    
Like what? Why? I mean the questions I ask are not click-baity or loaded or intended to get a rise out of someone reading it. I don't care about karma. I've seen stuff that's far worse than what I can ever post getting upvoted pushed to the top and even appear on popular/all and even to logged out users on the new reddit website.

I understand that's a way to filter spam too, to allow users who have spent more time participating more visibility. But I need to have XX karma/comments so I can make one single post? It just encourages people to comment even when there is no need to. I'm supposed to go to every post and then see that if there is something I can add to and if I don't get that sweet karma I don't get the right to post there? Okay.

Basically, it says that the cyberspace is felt as an extention of one's intrapsychic reality, therefore meeting core cmotional needs as if it was a real. The more immersive, the more it is felt as real, and the more the psychological theories can be applied to this new form of ""reality"".

I am much older now and some of the things that I posted were very ""edgy"" and unprofessional. I want to do as much as I can to clear my footprint from instagram.

Does anyone have any recommendations on what to do before deleting my instagram? 

Questions: 1. Can I delete all my DMs individually? I don't have a ton to do so I don't mind deleting them all individually if it helps me to clear my data.

nosurf,A Tale of Two Men - A Short Story Of How The Internet Squanders Lives," **This is a tale of two men. One of whom uses the internet extensively,** ***and another who uses it almost never.***

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first man kept up with the latest news. He kept his finger on the pulse of current trends. He knew what was cool and what was not. And he knew the details of the lives of celebrities.

*The second man had no idea what was in the news. He had no idea what the current trends were. And in the midst of his day to day routines, he forgot that he didn’t know.*

The first man, hearing online that women found dad-bods attractive, stayed out of the gym. Later, after hearing online that women preferred ripped bodies, he furiously started lifting weights.

*The second man exercised in a way that made his body look good when he looked in the mirror, and made him feel good throughout the day.*

The first man read online that women only like the top 10% of men on dating apps. He read online that women only liked men who were over 6 ft tall and had a 6 figure income. Being or having none of these things, he carried a sense of helplessness and low self-esteem around women, further repelling them away from him.

*The second man, upon seeing a woman he liked, simply approached her and started a conversation.*

The first man watched endless hours of pornographic content online. He had deep interests in a large number of exotic and strange fetishes. And he dreamed of one day recreating these extreme and obscure fetishes in reality with gorgeous girl with a beautiful face, perfect breasts and a nice curvy ass. He pleasured himself late into the night watching porn, fantasising, imagining and wishing.

*The second man explored sex multiple times a week with his partner.*

The first man heard about the vegan diet online. Then he heard about the paelo diet. He did research, read the latest scientific papers, read ebooks, listened to podcasts and took a long list of supplements. He spent years trying to understand the science of nutrition and achieve the perfect diet.

*The second man tried eating different kinds of foods and paid close attention to his body and his mind. After three months of trying different selections of food, he found a diet that made his body and brain feel good that he could could stick to for the rest of his life.*

The first man would carefully craft comments online; critiquing the works of others and delighting in the likes his comments received from other users.

*The second man spent his time creating content and art that he truly believed in.*

The first man was filled with knowledge. He talked fast and talked a lot, his mouth rattling off facts, news and gossip to those he met, as his hands gestured wildly to match his rapid speech. He knew something about everything; his knowledge spread wide and thin.

*The second man spoke slowly, deliberately and with purpose. The second man, despite not having much to talk about over a glass of wine, carried a presence with him that was felt by everybody in the room. A presence that often intimidated the men he encountered, while intriguing the women.*

The first man felt his neck stick out and his shoulders round forward; his body adapting permanently to the posture he held while using his laptop and phone.

*The second man stood straight up and his shoulders naturally fell backwards; his posture being something that never crossed his mind.*

The first man carried a constant nagging fear that he was missing something; that there was some piece of information he didn’t yet have that would finally fill in the missing puzzle piece of his life.

*The second man carried an aura that his own life puzzle had been complete since long ago.*

The first man felt resentful as he came to the end of his youth; feeling as though his life had passed quickly — his achievements few and far between.

*The second man proudly moved on from his youth, satisfied that his younger days were finally over and ready to move on to the next stage of his life.*",2023-02-17 22:51:42,1676674302

To me, tiktok is overhyped. It is this strange, crazy app that seems to have its own mind.

Bit of backstory: I deleted tiktok a couple of weeks ago after just getting fed up with this dumb app. My homepage was swamped with kids telling stories whilst playing roblox, plane crashes, 'miss karen english teacher dot com', teens going to the shops (Like whoever cares???) The app seemed to be filled with lots of dumbasses doing stupid things like burning coffee whitener (For anyone who does not know, it makes a sparkler effect sort of thing). The app, as aforementioned, seems to have its own mind, playing 3-4 things consistently, even when I had absolutely no interest in the topics. The app is just stuffed to the brim with nonsense and silly stuff that could be dangerous. Tiktok is a giant annoyance. After deleting tiktok, I feel much better.",2023-02-17 21:39:00,1676669940

nosurf,Has anyone lost a close friend to being chronically online?,"I wouldn't consider myself ""chronically online"" or ""terminally online"" as I've heard the term used. I'm a bit older and the internet has always been kind of a time waster and niche distraction to me. I have an extensive real life family and friend network so I've never felt the need to maintain internet relationships but I've occasionally interacted with communities on Reddit and Discord in entertaining ways, but almost always in kind of a passive way. I grew up with the idea that the internet was populated by strangers so its okay to interact socially but not divulge aspects of your real identity.

Anyway, a long term friend I knew from real life for close to 10 years recently cut off all ties to me. The problem was we had moved far apart so most of our interaction was done over text communication. We would rarely video call or even talk verbally on the phone sometimes over years. And then he completely disappeared off of social media so the only way I could interact with them was over Discord

This is where things got weird. Over time recently I started noticing him parroting these common internet and Twitter view points that I see posted all the time. He got very obsessed with left wing politics and these political streamer personalities on Twitch and Youtube and would constantly just bring up things discussed in their videos. For context, my friend had been alone for a long time, he didnt have many real life friends or a relationship and his job was work from home so he spent all of his time in these internet communities I think. I was probably the last remnant of his old life where he was in a big friend group of people that all hung out in person.

Needless to say we had a falling out and he no longer talks to me. I just couldnt accept how different our lives were (me with real life people and responsibilities and him spending probably all of his days on Discord, Twitter or other online communities). I had to sever the friendship because he was turning into such a toxic person and I blame the internet and social media for warping him that way. I genuinely think he has mental problems that will only get worse as he gets into middle age here (We're both in our 30s).

nosurf,Seems like everyone is encouraging us to be on our phones more,"Went to the store the other day and I got some special discount of like $25 off groceries for getting vaccinated but I can only use it if I ""install the app."" So many places do this now. Install the app and get some huge discount. So if you don't want to be involved in that you're spending more money.

And then also I can't even log into some stuff anymore without first having to get some phone notification with a code or something. I turned my phone off earlier and then went on Amazon and couldn't log in without turning my phone back on because they texted me some link I have to click to be able to log onto Amazon on my computer. I understand it's for safety but all this phone crap is just getting annoying. 

I really didn't want to turn my phone back on. Seems like whenever I turn it on I immediately get some freaking spam phone call. Like somehow these spammers know I turned my phone back on. Probably just coincidence but it's freaking weird. xD",2023-02-17 00:34:46,1676594086
nosurf,Is 4 hours of screen time good or bad? When using phone,"I just discovered this subreddit and I was wondering like usually my average screen time shows 6 hours but today I just checked and it shows 4 hours 21 min. 
I feel like I’m mostly sitting in one place if I use my phone and sometimes tiktok is so addicting that I spend countless hours just sitting and scrolling. I feel so bad like just shame. I could’ve used that time to do something productive",2023-02-17 00:23:55,1676593435

nosurf,A question about phone use and taking pictures.,"I’ve heard plenty of people argue both sides. Some people say we need to put our phones down and enjoy the moment and others encourage capturing the moment so you can enjoy it later.

I was thinking because these days you can see an old picture and a bunch of emotions come up. I don’t think you can avoid it. Thoughts and other memories are triggered from this picture. And yes it is a reminder that life it short and all of that but I think my question is, is that really necessary? Do we really need to be nostalgic? Do we need to look at the “good ol days”. Doesn’t that just make us feel like the present day sucks and isn’t as good as it used to be? 

200-300 years ago they just lived. After someone died or they had an experience they would just move on with their lives and never relive that moment again. They weren’t stuck in the past they were just completely present. I guess they read but I’ve personally never had the same nostalgia while reading. Maybe a bit but I find it more manageable. 

Are living these good memories really beneficial for us? Like every time I look back at picture of my childhood it will probably make me feel sad one way or the other even if it was a positive experience. 

My takeaway is this. Do we really need to capture everything? Post everything on Instagram?",2023-02-16 20:35:13,1676579713

Seriously guys, make it a priority to interact with people. Be nice. Find hobbies and interests. Find yourself. Develop who you are. Get out in that REAL world. Life can be truly beautiful. Please don't let Social Media change who you are. Don't let your online persona define you while your actual persona deteriorates.

Even though I don't have an addiction to this site, I feel I spend a lot of time consuming people's opinions, revisiting threads to feel belonged and connected. That again, is superficial. None of this matters.. none of ya'll know my name, what my life is like, what my personality is, nothing.

nosurf,Google Family Link cheat,"Hi everyone,

I need my phone for work for certain apps throughout the day (2FA), so I can't block off my phone completely.

I found Google Family Link app and setup my wife as the ""parent"", and it generally works well by allowing me to select which apps I need permanently (text, phone calls, work apps, banking, fitness)  and then blocking all the remainder apps when I've hit 45 mins of phone usage per day. If I'm on an app when 45 mins is up, it'll instantly kill the app and block it, sending me to my home screen.

Worked very well until I found a cheat that is sending me spiraling into my old habits. I have selected that Google Chrome and the Google app are to be blocked when my time is up. Google is the only app that doesn't instantly kill when my time is up as long as I am in a website (such as Reddit). I can't instantly go to new websites as the search engine is disabled, but I can ""jump"" around, such as go to r/wikipedia, from there click a link and it'll bring me to Wikipedia, from there I can search Instagram Wikipedia page, from there I can click external links to go to Instagram. 

I literally spend my whole day just doing this workaround. Does anyone else use Google Family Link and know if there is a way to disable this from my wife's settings?

I wanted to keep using Google Family Link as it's easy and I trust Google (lol), and works well on my Google Pixel, but this workaround is killing me.",2023-02-16 02:50:13,1676515813

nosurf,I Did A 48 Hour Dopamine Detox,"I intended it to be longer, but it was getting hard, so like with everything slightly difficult, it's easier to throw in the towel haha. Anyways, I allowed myself a couple of minutes of internet a day only to use eBay, since I sell stuff on there and that was it. I didn't play music anywhere, I drove in silence and lifted weights in silence. I ate meals while reading books. I watched one episode of TV at night and other than that I had 13+ hours to fill of reading, writing, drawing, jamming on guitar, practising rap freestyling, putting together a model kit, etc. 

The boredom was insane, but I was actually less restless than I was when I was on the internet all day. My thinking wasn't so frantic and obviously time passed way slower. It goes without saying that if you were doing things you wanted to do that you wouldn't want to go on the internet very much anyways. My activities were mostly just out of having nothing else to do, so they weren't really enjoyable per se, but I'm not reverting back to how I was, it's just the self imposed rule of no internet at all that is hard to sustain. After being back on for an hour, I really didn't miss anything and there's nothing I need to do on here.

2 days is obviously not enough time to draw any final conclusions, even though I know most people would find just that pretty hard, but I'd say you should give it a try.",2023-02-15 21:03:59,1676495039

Never had TikTok thank goodness, never fell for that one! I kept Snapchat because of some group chats with co workers and friends who can’t be in them due to having an android.

Lately I have an issue with waiting for friends to text me, texting friends constantly, and googling every little thing that comes into my head. I Google things to pass time, basically replaced all my time looking on Reddit for answers to random questions, and I constantly check my messages, Snapchat, to see if I got anything.

nosurf,What do you suppose is the psychological effect of upvoting/downvoting? I don't think it's good,"The bloodless way to justify upvoting and downvoting is that the ""best"" posts on a site like Reddit (but by far not the only social media platform) float to the top. But I think we all know how it gets used is users with agendas who disagree with some aspect of the post / the whole topic / the site / the user use downvotes to humiliate and cause division. Meanwhile the user can't help but take it personally- they come to a thread and decide to seek confirmation- of their experience, of their point of view, of their lives, even- and take every up and down vote personally. It's unavoidable. So you may be turning a thread into a referendum on a subject that's a hot button for you, but the net effect is you've made a random person feel worthless, just as surely as a ficiticious device that controls the brains of random people with a button that makes the one you pick feel like shit.

This chasm of a disconnect, inevitable considering the setting, is the engine of misunderstanding that can turn social media into a mosh pit on a dime.

Imagine walking home from school and some random toughs walk by. You don't notice them but they overhear you saying ""if only people could be nice to each other"" and because they see it as weakness, they jump you. Except we voluntarily put ourselves in this situation for hours a day- some, practically every making moment- every day of our lives. you think it might have some effect on your feelings of self worth?

I thought Reddit was worth risking the exposure because there are so many cool people here and there have been some truly upstanding examples of people being excellent to each other here, as well as some discussions as illuminating as any about certain topics taking place anywhere, it seems. 

Not sure if it's worth the risk of *feeling* constantly like I might get jumped, and the (probably significant) psychological toll it might have on me.

this isn't a ""bye reddit"" post or ""reddit bad"" post, just the feeling is coming down heavy on me today and I wonder if anyone else feels the same.",2023-02-15 15:24:17,1676474657

IG is just good for attention whoring.

And it's really quite boring as fuck.... I always delete it .. cus it's just boring.. I got what I wanted.... Just friends... No attention from horny males.... I guess that's good..

nosurf,Is the Internet a cheap time killer?,"Scrolling, binge-watching, whatever compulsive online activity you can do... it is it's ""cheap"" nature that makes it a easy time-killer/passtime/vice/hobby (you name it). And by ""cheap"" I do not necessarily mean the price of an internet plan (the may vary on gb/s, but it's affordable nowadays).  


Context &amp; example: I want to read, since I used to do it at some point as a teenager and I know the benefits it would bring me, besides getting away from the cheap pleasures that a social media or internet vortex provides; but books are fucking expensive, at least in my third world country. As a result, reading books, if not already almost extinct activity, is considered almost a luxury or something ""elitist"". Also, the motivation to do it: it's a demanding mental activity with little ""pleasure"" in the short-term (opposed to the internet).

nosurf,Tech detox retreat,"Anybody know of any retreats where phones aren't allowed? Like they take them before the retreat starts. I can feel things getting really bad for me where I can't be productive at all. I work from home everyday and it's nearly impossible to stop browsing the internet. I procrastinate my work and finish right before our deadlines. There's so many other side projects and creative endeavors I want to start but keep waiting and waiting or just do a very small amount and stop and go back to mindless internet. Another issue is I have chronic lyme so it makes me fatigued so I default to what's easy. The only productive thing I do everyday is go the gym and eat really healthy. Other than that it's internet, movies/tv shows, and video games. I love hiking and the outdoors but I've done all the trails and parks near me and by the time I get off work it's getting dark. I did a ayahuasca retreat last year and we were allowed to have our phone in our room and free hours so I still used it eventhough it was discouraged. The best I got was a 4 day back packing trip last year when I had no service. The problem is I dont have the self will to do it on my own and feel like I need to go somewhere to detox from tech.

nosurf,Trying again,"I once went 7 months with no social media at all, not Reddit, didn’t even watch YouTube, and only watched TV as a social activity. My screen time was so low and it was the first time I remember being mentally well adjusted since I was maybe 10 years old. I actually have had unrestricted internet access for half my life, so sometimes I feel like there are lots of people in my head watching me and controlling me. It got so bad at my worst that I would do things like apply for jobs and then not go the interviews or put makeup on and take it back off or sign up for classes and then drop out, because I was literally fighting my own decisions that I’d made in completely different states of mind. I didn’t feel like this at all during those 7 months I spent basically just working, hiking, and chilling.  Maybe I’m not someone who can handle being exposed to thousands of peoples inner thoughts every day.  I don’t know why I got back on but I have deteriorated a lot ever since. I don’t want to go insane again. I didn’t even have a sense of self anymore. I am going to get back off and try again. Maybe this time I’ll make it a year.",2023-02-14 22:00:40,1676412040
nosurf,Can you have a phone these days without Internet? Wifi specifically?,"I've had a lot of fatigue and motivation issues, and today I tried a dopmine detox for about 20 hours and felt tons better. Part of this was shutting off my phone and my router at about 8PM last night. For the last year especially my head's been swimming, I want to do things but I'm in a haze, last night before I unplugged I spent 15 min naked by the sink trying to move into the shower. I had to take one, I wanted to, but my whole body was kinda stuck in neutral.  

All that was gone today. Not rested, but far closer to it. Still some swimming but not up to my neck, but in the kiddy pool. I read 18 pages of a book I've been struggling to read for a year, a book I WANT to read mind you.

I turned on my phone for an hour to check with my walking partner then listened to some music and I started the mind swimming again. Turned on my router and PC to type this and I feel all the sickness coming right back. 

I think I have Electromagnetic sensitivity. Now I sympathize with the other goals of NoSurf, but those aren't my big goals right now. I need to get wifi out of my life yesterday. In theory I can get a wired only router (my complex handles the internet/cable, so it might not be that easy)

The bigger issue is my smart phone. I've been having lesser versions of these problems for at least 10 years, maybe more. I think I honestly need an old non-smart phone. The issue is I really really need access to things like Goggle Calendar and some sort of notes thing to write down grocery lists and if it's not on my phone I will toss it aside at some point and forget it. I have horrendous ADHD issues, which might clear up. As is, I can't turn my internet off except in airplane mode and that means no calls. and I'm not even sure it's actually turning off the wifi signal entirely.

Can one still purchase a phone that's entirely stand alone? No internet capacity at all? Just receive calls and texts? And if so where? I don't have the first clue where I'd go to find a non internet phone.

I'm 90% sure I need all the wiki out of my life yesterday. Cutting down on the internet is probably a good idea too, but one thing at a time.",2023-02-14 22:00:02,1676412002

nosurf,Help with Deleting my Facebook Account. Advice Much Needed,"I've had a facebook account for many years when I was a teenager. I do not use it very much nowadays but because I started using it roughly 10 or so years ago there are lots of things that I posted, commented, messaged people, etc that I do not want to associate with myself now. Mostly due to embarassment and it just being ""edgy"" which was i guess i probably thought was cool back then? I am now looking into deleting my facebook account and want to know if just deleting it permanently through the facebook settings is the best way to make sure all my information is ""deleted?"" I understand nothing is really ever ""deleted"" but I want to know what I can do to make it as hard as possible for someone to associate it to me.

nosurf,Should I quit Social Media?,"My whole feed is full of things I basically don’t care about. Why should I care about seeing one of my friends going to a meal that I’m not invited to? Why should I care about seeing my friends go out to a place which I’m not invited to? Why should I make an effort to upload pictures and videos of what I’m doing with people who basically don’t care about anyone but themselves and only what they’re doing in their own lives?

It all just seems like a never-ending competition. ""Look at me.. look at what I’m doing today.. look at what I’m doing tonight.. look at me at the club.. look at me at the gym.. look at me what I’m having for breakfast.. look at me and my partner.."" etc. What’s the point? If you aren’t doing those things yourself it’s just going to make you depressed watching other people do them, and if you are doing those things then the constant pressure to upload those pictures and videos of you doing those things is just going to make you depressed anyway. Either way, you’re going to be depressed. 

Also, ironically, basically nobody cares about what you’re doing or posting because they’re all doing the same thing - posting and showing off what they’re doing in their own lives, so it all just seems completely pointless.

i delete most of my reddit accounts within 1-2 weeks and only make new ones when i am seeking niche knowledge/info and think a thread could be helpful. soon enough i will stop doing this because i am learning books and people i meet IRL are usually a better resource.

i don't feel any strong urge to post things to the internet anymore (though i recognize someone could point out the pointlessness of this post). i also never take digital photographs anymore. documenting any part of my life is never on my mind, which is a change i appreciate.

sadly, i still surf a lot. usually just to pass time in my day when i'm too lazy to do my hobbies etc. i also still write so many digital notes (lists, journaling, ideas, you name it-writing helps me process thoughts because otherwise i do not actually think in language) when i could easily write physical ones.

this next month i'm going to work on improving these by being outside and moving my body more, instead of surfing, and using my notebooks more.

good luck everyone!",2023-02-14 20:02:04,1676404924
nosurf,What’s the point of using Social Media?,"Almost everyone likes to say that using Social Media is productive and useful but I really don’t see how that’s the case. It doesn’t matter whether your life is good or not, how many places you go to, how many friends you have, etc. You could be regularly posting what would seem like really good memories, for example, a nice picture of you on the beach, then a picture of you on a night out in a club, and then a picture with you with your partner, etc, and you could still be miserable. What benefits does this actually provide? Even if you’re doing all of these things, the constant urges and pressure to take pictures and videos just to upload them to Facebook and Instagram would make you miserable in itself. You’re not really living in the moment and the number 1 reason why people share things in the first place is to be part of the ""competition"" of who has a better life. Being on Social Media means you’re constantly participating in a never-ending competition against your ""friends"" and followers. 

People like to say that they like to share images and videos just to ""make a nice looking profile of their memories"", but in most cases that’s false. 99% of them are uploading things just to show off and essentially brag in peoples faces. The amount of self importance in these peoples posts is just so high, and the ironic factor about it is, nobody actually cares about what those people are doing because they’re doing the same thing, posting their own photos and videos just to show off. So what do you have when you take all of this into consideration? A huge pointless competition full of posts screaming ""look at me.. look at what I’m doing today.. look at what I’m doing tonight.. look what I’m eating for breakfast.. look at me at the gym.. look at me and my partner.."" etc. It’s all just a ""look at me"" attitude. 

Social Media is just based around pure selfishness, and constantly highlights the worst parts of human nature.",2023-02-14 19:59:06,1676404746

# My journey with a dumbphone

📷[**3G**](https://www.reddit.com/r/dumbphones/search?q=flair_name%3A%223G%22&amp;restrict_sr=1)

Today, I made an account here after realizing that this community exists, and isn't just a great dream. I am very technophobic, and after trying 5 phones, some of them twice, I stumbled upon this phone, the Doro 6620. Little to none information was anywhere on this phone, but reading the amazon/Trustpilot review, I convinced myself that this was the phone for me. Doro is a phone company that are most known to seniors and disabled people, and which I had never known of before. Sure, I had seen their phones in Tesco and O2, sometimes EE or Vodafone, but I never really thought it through. The Tesco mobile quiz suggested the Doro 6620, and sure, it seemed great. This phone had the bare minimum, and yet fulfilled almost every need of mine. I have been using it for nearly 2 months, so here is my full review:

Pros:

Very simple

Runs on both 2 and 3g (3g is going to be removed after a few years, but 2g will still work until 2033)

Very high level of customization (you can personalize it like an android and even block everything on it)

Adequate camera with customizable resolution (3mp)

Video player, which a lot of these dumbphones lack

Voice recorder, which is hard to use but still exists

Games like snake and f1 racing

Email app, which allows you to see pictures/documents

Cheap service and more or less cheap phone (7.50 a month including service)

Calls sound well when using HD voice

Has a Whitelist

Plays radio

Notes, alarm and daily reminders

Cons:

Only 1 alarm can be set

Voice recorder very hard to find

No torch

No external screen

Now for my review:

Unboxing the phone was relatively easy, and so was setting it up. The phone comes with 5 themes that change how the interface looks, and you can change how the apps are presented. The phone has 2 games, F1 racing, and Snake. Although it is possible, recording voice must be done by starting a mms and then not sending it, which then can be found in the file manager. The text can be made much larger, and there are 15 different wallpapers to choose from. The phone also has a personal organiser which allows you to set 1 alarm, make notes and set a daily reminder. The ringtones are quite pleasant, and the alarm is very loud, and cannot be made any quieter. The camera is adequate, and can zoom or increase/decrease light. The phone also allows mms and email, and features t9 texting. It takes a 32gb SD card, and has a battery that lasts 2-3 days on high use. It also has a signal status checker, and a weather app that shows you the temperature in the night and in the day, and displays temperature on the home screen. The phone has a case made by Doro and still looks funky in and out of the case. It has a nice, sleek design and a 2010s look, and feels very thin whilst not in the case.

I probably have forgotten something, and so I might edit this post at some time, so don't be surprised. Also, I will add every question comment here with its answer. If curious, do not dm me, but comment below.

But going into 2022 a friend told me to use the app more so I did but it backfired on me as i got addicted and couldn't be off the app for 10 minutes. this has been going on for a while and I have found that I am unable to focus on anything or even read a book and my life revolves around social media.

No, not my actual account, just the app itself. I’m not ready to delete my account yet, but when I am, it will be there waiting, and that gives me some comfort

Twitter has been a major source of my anxiety for years. Truthfully, I never really had a good reason to use it - I would just immediately turn to it out of boredom and habit. Multiple times a day. And yet, it still holds some fond memories that I’m not yet ready to let go of

If you want to do the same, here’s what I recommend:

1. Make your account private/lock it.
2. For extra “freedom” go ahead and deactivate it. (Or if you’re 100% sure, delete the account permanently)
3. Delete the app.

You may find yourself to never want to use a social media again after that - in which case, your account will be there for you to reactivate and then delete forever

nosurf,"Life wasted on the internet, a warning","Hey all,

I was born in the late 90s and got my first computer in 2010. I was addicted to runescape and youtube, however prior to 2010 my only experience with computers was at school and the library. I was an extremely sensitive kid and used to get bullied so I was super aggressive as a way to defend myself. I found solice on the internet and because I wasn't causing too much trouble my parents didn't find it too bad.

My teenage years were just go to school, come home go on the playstation and then go on the computer. I never had a girlfriend, and I never did anything remarkable at all, no sports achievements, nothing, my only achievements were on video games.

Fast forward to now, I'm 23, and I'm addicted to the internet. I lost my childhood friends, so my companion is with people across the globe, I've never had a girlfriend (I'm not a stereotypical computer geek) but I do have bad socialisation issues, I find most people incredibly boring. 

I can't express my thoughts in depth because my brain just doesn't let me, but essentially, because of my childhood conditions, I'm now a socially awkward loner at the age of 23. I come from an Middle Eastern family originally and being able to socialise, have something normal to talk about is a must. I don't want to totally blame the internet, but I would say it's probably a large cause of 99% of my feeling of my life failings.",2023-02-13 17:50:49,1676310649

I know some of these I purposely saved for future reference, like images I like, etc. But I don't feel like spending the time on my computer to sort through them all, which would be antithetical to my attempts to minimize unnecessary tech time.

I'd truly rather delete them all, but there are probably a handful of important documents in there that I actually may **need** (like tax docs etc).

I'm curious if others have been in this situation and how they handle it. I love keeping things super organized so this bothers me. Right now I just have it a file that I'm pretending is the trash but not actually deleting.",2023-02-13 06:52:54,1676271174

nosurf,What helped me - Schema Theory / Therapy,"Schema therapy is a psychological approach that integrates cognitive-behavioral and psychodynamics theories. According to schema therapty, there are three ways to cope with negative emotions: Avoidance, Hipercompensation and Resignation. The one that is interesting to us is avoidance. This coping style makes sure that we disconnet from our emotions, thoughts, and reality itself, and that is my very case. This coping style manifests throught the Detached Protector Mode (modes being states of mind, moods, gathering of cognitive information associated to affective memories) and Detached Self-Soother. These modes are the case when one seeks to avoid their emotions throught surfing, hence the term ""mindlessly scrolling"". The subject that is being avoided differs for each person, and it can range from self-loath, self-criticism, abandonment feelings, angry feelings, etc... 

The bottom line is: Surfing is usually a coping mechanism to an inner issue built over years of bad experiences, therefore  therapy and self-care (in its many forms) is always recommended.",2023-02-13 00:19:08,1676247548
nosurf,"Internet overuse, echo chambers, and the far-left","Before I get into my experience, I want to say that this is not a ""the alt-left is just as bad as the alt-right"" story. I don't believe in the ""alt-left"" and I still consider myself a socialist, but I was in an extremely unhealthy echo chamber. 

I've always been politically active. I frequent protests and I quite literally used to be a blue-haired feminist (still a feminist, just no blue hair anymore). I have also always consumed leftist content, think along the lines of ""BreadTube"" creators. Tiktok took my beliefs and multiplied them by a million. At first, it was just posts about anti-racism and LGBT rights, topics I really cared about, but I was a frog in a pot of water. Over the years, my fyp became a constant stream of content talking about how capitalism is going to destroy society, how it's impossible to be happy under capitalism and I was going to be miserable for the rest of my life and there's nothing I could do about it. I was spending upwards of 8 hours a day listening to this content.

I feel like the tiktok algorithm took my reasonable concern about the alt right and amplified it until I had nothing left but fear. I couldn't talk to my friends about \*anything\* anymore, because it always turned into a lecture about consumerism or car dependent culture or zoning laws or the alt right pipeline and how it was destroying community and killing democracy. Everything I was being pushed was extremely pessimistic and made me feel like there was no hope for the future. I would often feel like I would be better off dead than ""stuck in a capitalist hellscape"" 

My final straw was a post talking about how societal collapse is inevitable, democracy is dead, and I needed to start storing food and learn homesteading skills. I was completely buying what the post was saying and then, I had a small moment of clarity and immediately deleted the app. I honestly didn't even fully think about what I was doing. I just knew every time I opened tiktok, my life got worse. 

I don't want to feed conspiracy theories, but I feel like tiktok is purposefully doing this to further political polarization in the US. 

It's been a little over a month and I still can't engage with political content without feeling panicky. I still hold a lot of my same beliefs about healthcare, public transportation, civil rights, anti-fascism, and so many other things, but I am not in a good enough headspace to handle those topics. 

I'm sharing all of this because I have never heard anyone else talk about the danger of far-left pessimism. I feel quite embarrassed about how much this has affected me and I hope someone else can relate to my experience. I just wanted to be a good person and instead I ended up addicted to outrage and fear.",2023-02-12 22:53:46,1676242426
nosurf,I've made some progress,"At this point I don't even like the internet unless I use it for something to benefit me, like new music, fitness, mindfulness, etc. I can't stand what the internet has become. Once modern social media blew up, and this disgusting ugly iOS 7 flat design took over every site, there's no joy on the internet anymore. Mostly just an endless scroll-hole of vapid brain rot content. I don't even know how my friends look at Instagram all day. I go on there for maybe 10 minutes a day to see some funny shit (I don't follow any FOMO-inducing accounts) but it's just so lifeless now. Back in 2010-13 it was different, a fun place to share images of basically whatever.

nosurf,Goal: to reduce screen time from 10 hours to 3-5 hours a day.,"So I checked my screen time early in the morning and realized last week I reached nearly 10 hours screen time per day.

Too much screen time and mindless consumption is probably the reason to my emotional dysfunction I experience at times, and overthinking,and spiral of depression and negativity.

Just this morning I realized that When I close my eyes or leave my devices, I feel an urge to go on a screen that flashes light, or engage with activities online (with my friends or watch videos etc) 

I use phone distraction has a coping mechanisms when I have disturbing emotions or feelings I don’t know how to deal with, and a cope to loneliness as well. I want to live healthy, and I don’t want to be bothered anymore.

I don't really have a problem with any other social media sites though I do need to find something other than refreshing Reddit during my limited downtime. All my other interests, reading, video games, or woodworking, are all boom or bust. Fitting those in and around kid and family activities is pretty tough so that's why I fallback on Reddit so much.

nosurf,By God This is Crazy,"I just created a Reddit account. Don't ask why. I turned on the NSFW button in the settings because I want to see 👀. Instead first thing I see is a video taken inside a plane as it crashed and killed everyone inside. 

Ah...my point is not limited to that. The internet has just taken over my life. It's no longer a ""tool"" for any purpose. I miss my childhood (early 2000s) when I'd use the internet to browse simple websites about cool cars...the kind of websites with wacky colored fonts and that whole amateurish vibe. The ones made by hobbyists. Or simply playing Monster Truck on MSN. 

Then the mid 2000s came. I started checking out websites of possible schools I'd go to. I remember seeing something about Abu Ghraib in Iraq but it's all hazy and I wasn't really interested. This could be my imagination. Then around 2007 I started using YouTube. Next thing you know my friend tells me to make a Facebook account. And it has all been going downhill since then.

To be honest, I don't even like Reddit. I dislike the weird characters that show up as profile pictures. It seems inappropriate for grown ass men and women to use. Secondly, whenever I read anything written by anyone (mostly) there's always some snarky tone that I imagine in my head that puts me off. Twitter is already infamous. Facebook is boomer town. Instagram exists to make you feel bad about your life. Comments section anywhere especially YouTube is...not good. Also I feel that whenever something is discussed anywhere by a mob on the internet, I feel like I have to take the opposite stance. 

Yes, one thing that's great about the internet is that I've discovered a lot of good music. The internet can be a great place if you are using it like someone would in the late 90s or early 2000s. Can't imagine how people got by with huge vinyl. 

As for porn...one eventually becomes desensitized to it. All these women start to look the same. You see them and you immediately forget them as you keep scrolling down.

nosurf,Incongruence between two personas,"I have been facing internet addiction since some time, though it is a little better now, but I was wondering about something which I wanted to hear others thoughts on.

There is this disconnect I feel between my online persona and the real life person I am. Though we are the same, and this is a part of me, everything, including my flaws, insecurities, impulsiveness, anxiety and  consequent inconsideration of others feelings become amplified online. It's like a rotten child in me is given free reign to do what my mind desires without facing any consequences, behind this veil of anonymity. It's really jarring to come back to reality and think that you're actually not this nice person people think you to be. I probably make the same mistakes in real life that I did online, though the probability and frequency of that would be less, but I was more brash online, and I feel really guilty. It's like my mind is overstimulated with all the dopamine and adrenaline evoked by everything I see online, and I get stuck in this cycle of obsession with my thoughts, though they may be untrue but I believe them at the moment, in this reel world and my brain rushes to react compulsively and sometimes, just blows the fuse. There is an inability to step back and view my actions objectively, and I end up making a series of bad decisions. Everything anyone does online, despite being a stranger, I take personally and begin to question my sanity and my conscience.

Translating the guilt to real life, there is a disconnect. I wonder if I really did those things I did online. Was I capable of such carelessness? Such disregard for people? It really scared me. It's like I'm an imposter in real life and one day, people will find out what a creep I was because of my inability to reign in my emotions.  It's not like this is a simulation without consequences. There are actual people behind the screen whom I, though temporarily, hurt with my behavior or my comments, though I never meant for it to happen. Have you guys faced this moral dilemma?

But it’s gotten worse they don’t want to interact, from the minute they wake up to when they go to bed it’s scrolling or what’s fake story videos and they are a house husband so he rarely has to go out unless it’s to the shop, half of his Christmas presents haven’t been opened and used, he doesn’t spend time with anyone and doesn’t even pay attention to the dog as much as he use too. It’s gotten to the point were he doesn’t clean up until last minute and I know that because he’s told me or just leaves it and it’s left to me. I’ve tried explaining about the social media but then I’m met with aggressive and sharp attitudes and so I give up. I can’t just unplug the internet since it is needed to other things. He doesn’t talk to anyone but that side want him on every social media and when his account went down he made a new one and when I spoke to his sister she was like he should be on all of them so I can’t remove it since they will know it’s me. I had destroyed my relationship with social media and now it’s destroying my relationship?

I’m so lost I don’t want to make drastic decisions but he’s never present and he never does anything so it’s more for me or it doesn’t get done until later.

I’m at a lost since it has caused arguments and he knows he’s addicted and doesn’t care.

Anyone have any advise or is it completely over and social media has ruined that?",2023-02-11 09:27:43,1676107663

nosurf,spectacle,"the internet is vast. there are what, let's just, for the sake of argument, say there are 100 million websites on the internet (the visible one, at least) that you can browse to at any given time.

that's 100 million. and we haven't counted the pages within each site. the average, assuming it's a website to sell you something, would have a landing, an about, a contact, a dashboard maybe, a pricing page. that's 5 pages. multiply that over 100mil, you have 500mil pages you have yet to explore. (note, I omitted content sources which make up a huge majority of the internet, things like blogs, social media, articles, etc.)

this is information overload. there's too much for the brain to sift through. our greatest asset now has turned into our greatest liability. and the information that is easiest to parse, easiest to digest, easiest to consume becomes the most spread. the law of least common denominator (I think there's more to this as well, because content that requires pre-text will naturally spread far less densely). what this means is that misinformation now is easily exploited as a tool for power. you don't need to say the right things you just need to make the most ""feelable"" information.

imagine trying to sift through all of this and let your brain figure out what is most relevant or important. the process of learning becomes actively hindered. 

what develops as well is a comfort in information. because the contrast of silence is so immense.

the people who know more about human psychology spend so much money on reducing friction (to the dope). one can argue the root is money. when one goal has been elevated above all else, everything else, including and especially consumers, becomes a tool to that end.

the attention economy is more than just our eyeballs. it is directly our very lives that have been commoditized. this is guy debord's point in ""society of the spectacle.""

*the solution is to be just as radical as the spectacle is just as omnipresent. *

it means removing any and all sources of infinite feeds. because as long as content is generated, the vehicle for power becomes the diversity of human thought.

if one wants to remain sane one needs to be uncomfortable. we need to return to when technology was no longer where we spent our lives. it's a concern that societies of the past haven't ever felt to this scale, adding on top of that extreme social isolation resulting from a global pandemic.

*I can feel my very brain saying ""stop. just please stop""*

it's so scary to even think about. ask yourself, if youtube no longer existed in the world, if tiktok/instagram/twitter/facebook were no longer present, would our societies be better off? the mere fact that one can jump at an answer is dire enough.

imagine all the hours people would spend instead reflecting. living presently. actually *being *better people. suddenly finding the willpower to overcome addiction. and, as a result, less resources needed to be devoted to mental health. stronger communities, more active participation in government, more equitable societies. more educated individuals. this is an non-exhaustive list of all that the society of the spectacle not just prevents but actively hinders.

**human potential for profit.**

because when people actualize their potential, they resist control. it means more government revolts, not less. it means more instability. and maybe that's for the better.

all this from just blocking access to excessive computer usage. butterfly effect at it's finest.

(weirdly, it also means skinnier people. reducing the burden on public welfare, less spent on health insurance, and fewer doctor visits among other things)

too much information means that **all **of it from a baseline carries the same weight. the alternative is curation. the follower model, subscriptions, newsletters. all in an attempt to reduce the constant stream.

the alternative is not to produce less, it's to consume less. the alternative is not more/less but different. to produce more but more *meaningfully*. we should ask ourselves why sometimes intelligent people turn to being content creators over teachers and educators.

the society of the spectacle is like a perpetual motion machine. it runs on its own power and has become more powerful than our own institutions. once you see it, it's like the snoop dogg photo, you see it everywhere. everywhere.

the 1% may be the ones who benefit the most from all of this. but they too are a product of this spectacle, as ignorant as one can imagine they could possibly be.

lastly, if they're using you, use ***them**. *get what you need from them and run. google maps is amazing. being able to reach almost anyone anywhere in the world at any time, that's dope too. but run once it passes that point. the world wide web was never meant for entertainment but now it's an economy.

the difficulty is that great technology cannot carry itself forward simply by being great. you need money. and the problem is that money eventually turns itself from the vehicle for change to the system on which change happens.",2023-02-11 03:44:26,1676087066

Scrolling through forums on how to stop scrolling is like going to an AA meeting in a bar. You will not find one magical post that gives you the motivation you need to quit surfing. It's simply an action you have to cease, and from there find a substitute to fill the time you would normally be surfing.

nosurf,Physically ill from detox,"Hi guys. As of two days ago, I realized just how much being on social media was pulling me away from what mattered most to me and what would be more important for my future. I can't attach screenshots, but for the past 4 weeks my total screen time has been 94 hours, 93.5 hours, 89.5 hours, and 96 hours. Yesterday morning, after many frustrated tears and general feelings of anxiety, I said screw it and deleted my social accounts and apps. Since then, I've been physically nauseous, cried several times, felt as though there was something scratching out of my chest, and have not been eating or drinking much. I KNOW this is what's best for me but the anxiety and slight depression from the lack of constant dopamine hits in the form of likes, messages, comments, retweets, etc is so overwhelming. My social media usage really kicked off last October when I moved back in with my family to study for school. I believe I tried to use it as a form of escapism. I don't see much of my friends, although I have been reaching out in the past 48-72 hours. I feel very isolated and an overwhelming sense of loneliness. I've been trying to tell myself I'll be okay even though I definitely don't feel it. 

I did have hobbies before like gaming, reading on my tablet, photography, etc. but those just don't seem appealing right now. My plan is to replace the urge to constantly reach for my phone by playing a little bit on my Switch (with which I have a lot more self control with). 

Hopefully I can look back in a few months on this post and say I've come a long way.",2023-02-11 00:49:16,1676076556

I'm a smartphone addict, getting from around 30 to 60 hours a week on my phone. to me it's always been an escape from reality, and unfortunately it's gotten to a point where I just can't let it keep spiraling out of control. I was wondering if anyone who also suffers from this would be willing to chat? I'm not really looking for guidance, but guidance is appreciated. I'm just looking to talk to someone else out there with the same problems as me.   


I'd love to know your story, and possibly share mine. To tell you a little about me, so reaching out is easier, I'm a college student from the U.S. and I love to code. It's just so sad that this addiction has stolen away so much time from doing the things that I love. In the moment binging on your phone makes you feel comfortable and safe, but in reality it's stealing time away from what matters the most.    


Would love to talk to someone who feels the same.  


Thanks in advance.",2023-02-10 17:38:55,1676050735
nosurf,Does anyone have any favorite books that depict life with no internet? Looking for book recommendations,"I’m currently reading Charlie and The Chocolate Factory. Something I’ve been liking about the book is how close knit and simple their life is. They’re really poor and survive on cabbage soup so that’s the bad part. But I like how Charlie and his parents live with their parents so it’s 4 grandparents, Charlie’s parents, and him. The grandparents all sleep in one bed but Charlie visits them and sits in the middle of their bed and they tell him stories about Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory. Then Mr. Bucket brings home the newspaper announcing the winners of the golden tickets and the grandparents all comment and everybody talks about it together. It’s just how close knit they are and how there isn’t any tech it’s just newspapers and stuff it’s kinda cool. 

Another book I recently reread from childhood was Little House In The Big Woods by Laura Ingalls Wilder. It’s set in the 1800s so there’s hardly anything to do not like in modern life where’s there’s TV, internet, or videogames. Laura and her sister play with paper dolls, and play outside a lot. Their father hunts for all their food and they eat all their meals home cooked. He gives them a pig’s bladder to blow up like a balloon and play catch with it. Then at night he’ll play his fiddle and sing for them, or tell them stories. They just live a super simple life and it’s a cozy vibe. Of course life was probably tough in the 1800s since there was hardly any medicine or advancements in that sense of peoples life expectancy. And the fact the dad has to go out hunting for a pig or a bear for food instead of there being a supermarket or something. But the no computers or tv is kinda cool to see how they lived back then.

As part of my no surf efforts, I’ve been trying to read more in general. And these kind of books are nice to read to get inspiration. I’m 26, so last I knew of life without internet was in the 2000s 15-20 years ago.

nosurf,The Best Decision &amp; The Ultimate Lesson,"So, i came across this subreddit when searching for why i was in such a brain fog state and decided to make some changes. Here's the most important lesson for me:

# Attention is the game, and the algorithms are their weapon.

I went down and 'filtered' most of the algorithms that were controlling my attention. My main problems were with Instagram, YouTube and Reddit. 

\- For Instagram: I unfollowed everyone that isn't friends or family (all brands, influencers, famous people - gone). I deleted it from my phone and downloaded an extention that limits my time on their website (5 minutes per day) and blocks the feed and the explore bar.

\- For YouTube: I unfollowed most of the people i were following. Limited the app time on the phone for 1 minute. That way I still have the app if someone send me something but i have the clue to not watch it on my own. On the computer i downloaded an chrome extention that only shows me the search bar (home, subscriptions, everything gone...). 

\- For reddit: deleted from my phone and unfollowed basically every subreddit, making it not so interesting. Now, similar to YouTube, it works as an search engine only.

Obs: donwloading AdBlock is a must.

Now I have much more time and focus that is crazy. 

The main change here is that the information is not coming to me everytime from everywhere, now I am the one going for information only when I want or need.",2023-02-10 11:31:06,1676028666

nosurf,Assortment of things that have been helping me make progress,"&amp;#x200B;

**have a goal when going on and keep it in mind. afterall, it's a tool now.** 

For example, I've been severely limiting my time on twitter due to surrounding toxicity in my spheres and the fact the app is downgrading by the day---and also it's my personal worst app in terms of addiction (funny how that works). So if I'm going to DECIDE to go on I may \*think “ok, let me check the messages of this GC, and see the recent posts on this hashtag.” It also helps me to keep a mental note when I remember something I need  to use the SNS for, and pile them up as much as I can to all do in one session. It can be easier said than done, but it’s worked more often than not for me, especially over time where I’ve grown disillusioned. 

**enough surfing the internet! let's surf the urge instead**

Basically, for me, this means when I realize I have an urge I don’t want to be having---I directly acknowledge what it is, sit there with the urge, and go back to what I was doing (or stare at the wall). Yes it’s what people might call “willpower” and yes it sounds a tad lackluster, but it has been a savior in subsiding urges. 

**you can predict the future, because you’ve already lived it!  (reminding yourself how it goes)**

This can go very well with the last one. Let's say I feel the urge to look at a few youtube shorts. When I realize the urge, I’ll remind myself of what has occurred in other instances: I bit into my time, I saw something that put me in a bad mood, I felt hollow watching them outside of a few quick laughs, etc. I think the feeling aspect, and seeing how *most of the time* the “good” emotions are empty as hell, is really important to me on this one. 

**gratitude journaling, the one I almost wrote off**

Simply, writing about things I enjoy and appreciate. I’ve personally been using prompts I find on google images. When I’ve lived so long in a world of digital dopamine chases, it’s nice to get back into touch with the small things that bring joy. Of course, don’t force it, and actually appreciate these things when you are living them too!

nosurf,I think I’m gonna delete my Facebook,"The only parts about it I’ll really miss:

- The sense of “connection” I feel to the outside world. As someone who spends most of their time in their apartment alone, this has helped me feel like I’m apart of something/ less isolated.

- The support groups I’m apart of. But I think instead what I’m going to do is try to find IRL support groups.

- The memes. I love memes cause they’re funny and the stupid posts that validate precisely how I feel. The validation often helps me feel less crazy when I hear about someone thinking or doing something that I do, that I thought was really odd. Also I have gotten some little bits of wisdom from certain posts. 

- Old things I’ve posted, “Facebook memories.” It’s kinda like a journal in a way for me, if I look back to certain dates I actually feel nostalgic about certain posts LOL. 


That’s about it though. Most of my Facebook friends are old coworkers who couldn’t give a single fuck about me. Nothing I post actually benefits/changes any IRL relationships of mine. Actually most people don’t even give a shit about my posts at all. 

I stalk exes, random old coworkers, acquaintances, high school classmates. People who wouldn’t even remember me if you mentioned me, and who have absolutely no relevance to my life. 

Social media is mostly about vanity. People want to make themselves look good/moral, and to polish a certain image of themselves and project it to their friends. It’s a popularity game in a way and I sure as hell have never been good at those. It’s sucks my time up.

nosurf,Leaving my phone in the car at night,"Hey guys, just wanted to share this. As a 25 year old male I’ve been severely addicted to the internet (and pornography as a byproduct) for most of my life to the point where I basically would use it to fill every free second of time I have, and for mind-numbing crap at that too. I’ve also been chronically sleep deprived since middle school because ever since technology entered my life, I never had the discipline to put down the phone/laptop at night and just go to sleep, which absolutely destroyed the quality of the small amount of sleep I actually did get. I moved into a new place a few months ago and I would’ve have to set up the WiFi myself, which I never did because I didn’t want to add another bill, but also because I was getting along fine just using a mobile hotspot to scroll YouTube videos and porn (I have unlimited data). However, after a really bad binge recently (caused by some pain from other events in my life) of staying up literally all night before work and hating myself for being a porn addict, I felt like my technology use was completely out of control and I didn’t have the self-control to discipline myself. I did the only thing I felt like I had the power to do to control it and just left my phone in the glove box in my car, so there’s no way for me to connect to the internet when I’m in my apartment. It’s only been a few days since I started doing this but it’s really impressive to me the effect that this has had. Now when I get home after work I tend to get bored, and once I realize I can’t scroll mindlessly through videos, I look around my house for things I can do (since there’s nothing else TO do). I’ve finally started cleaning up my place and catching up on things I’ve needed to do as far as organization, and I’ve started messing around with the guitar again. Basically just want to say if you’re having trouble disciplining yourself, you might just want to get rid of the internet at your house and see where your mind goes to fill in that void.",2023-02-09 12:45:48,1675946748

nosurf,Are there any online games good for socializing? (Better than Reddit?),"I have a bit of a unique situation. My main issues are with Reddit &amp; Youtube; I'm at the point where I spend almost all my waking time on both. I haven't had friends for around 8 years. I've also spent a huge amount of time in my room, due to going to university. I'm 30.   
  
The main problem is that there isn't anywhere to socialize with my peer-group in my town, and there are no cities within driving distance. Every club exists only for babies, kids, teenagers, and seniors (55+)... except very rare themed clubs (ex. hiking) that turn out very small numbers of people, who again happen to be a lot older than me. I do plan on moving this year, but I'm very aware that people in my age range are extremely busy with work and their families. I've heard that a lot of people only see their friends once a month or less-- and even then, those are friends they've had for years.  
  
The main reason I'm addicted to Reddit are the 'matchmaking' subs, like /r/needafriend. Before 2019ish, you could find normal people (for lack of better term) on these subs.

nosurf,Deactivated my twitter account and I feel a bit sad.,"I deactivated my twitter account because I was spending too much time on my phone (not just twitter but also reddit). Every morning when I wake up, the first thing I do is I check my twitter and I get a rush of dopamine so much so that my head starts to feel dizzy.

I don’t necessarily engage in drama as my twitter account is private and anonymous. I only use it to follow my interests and vent. But that’s what I miss. The part where I can just vent my thoughts without judgement. Twitter feels like a safe space for me because it’s a place where I can freely express myself without thinking about what other people might think of me.

Another thing I miss is a moot of mine. I can’t call her exactly my friend, but she lends an ear to me and sometimes I interact with her. During the pandemic she was one of the people I interacted with especially when my friends were busy and had something else going on with their lives. The thing about having moots, they pop in and out of your lives, you don’t know them, but at the same time you’re privy to what’s going on in their lives through their tweets.",2023-02-09 02:14:33,1675908873

nosurf,YouTube's my only real vice now,"Being online is now synonymous w being on YouTube for me but it's not like I even enjoy it anymore. Yet here I am, scrolling through shorts and watching the same repetitive videos again and again for like 10 hours a day. YouTube stuck around for this long cuz hey, there is stuff of value, good, educational stuff on it but I'd be kidding myself if I claimed that I actually use it productively. Because all I did today was watch videos of pudding the munchkin cat, Street food lady in Thailand, pop culture video essays(which I honestly don't even have much knowledge on for me to be able to critically consume the content), self help and life style content stuff( which usually is click baity af ""organize and finish your work infinity times faster"" ""why I only sleep on the left side of my bed"" like pleaseee). I'm so tired of it all. YouTube makes me lose even more interest in my nearly non existent hobbies cuz I just feel like "" that's it?"" 

 Everything is so in your face and trying to get your attention which is true for most of the internet I just can't deal with it anymore. Even supposedly good stuff like school of life or einzelgänger seem like they're trying to brainwash you into having certain beliefs or smth I can't trust anything no more.

nosurf,"LeechBlock ""Count time spent on these sites only when browser tab is active"" counts time even when the tab is not active or even is suspended.","I would like to use LeechBlock in a way that seems not to be possible. There are sites that I keep opened in tabs because I often get back to them - a podcast, a movie or even work related. I limited these to 1 hour every half of a day because I tend to sink in a lot of time in engaging on the forum or just browsing. So I decided that 2 hours a day is more than enough.

Sometimes when I do other stuff I would like to be able to listen to the podcast for an unlimited amount of time. So I figured that I could use the option ""Count time spent on these sites only when browser tab is **active**"" under ""When to Block"". I would keep the opened podcast in a tab that is **not active**, it would send the audio but not count the time as spent on these websites.

But whenever these sites are opened in a non active Tab, even suspended - LeechBlock still counts the time if the tab with that adress exist as time spent there, as if I was actively looking at it.

Is there any way to force LeechBlock to count the time on these sites only if it is an active tab?",2023-02-07 05:13:52,1675746832

People are mean. It's not enough to express your own opinion anymore. Now we reach for anything to make the other person look as dumb/evil as possible. Especially Reddit. Redditors *love* to tell you when think you're wrong. What's even more disappointing is it's no longer just a political issue. It's everywhere in every fucking niche from cooking to skating to goddamn water.

Maintaining respect towards another person despite disagreeing with them on a subject isn't ""toxic positivity"" that's just being a decent fucking human being.

For example, I don't like longboarding. Stylistically, I think it's very ugly. That doesn't mean I think every longboarder is a subpar human being that deserves to be banished from society, but apparently, that's how I'm supposed to think because that's how everyone on Reddit fucking acts lmfao.

nosurf,Stop having internet fights.,"I mean it. When you feel the urge to argue (from hobbies to politics), ask or remind yourself of a few things

&amp;#x200B;

* Does it really matter if they understand you on something if it's just like talking to a brick wall everytime? I'm a fairly politically opinionated person for example, so trust me I understand the importance of a good discourse sometimes. But this is the internet, how often do you actually see a good discussion and not just a flat argument of no substance? Even if you do see a mature discussion, it's important to remember it's hindered by things such as word limits or difficulty understanding tone online. Overall: Have discussions and debates online if they're not just online screaming matches with snarky one-ups, but even then take in consideration the barrier of the internet. 
* You don't know who this person is. A convicted stalker? Maybe. A 10 year old? Maybe. Someones dog? Maybe. A bot? Probably. Essentially: A good amount of these internet arguments are not arguments you would get into if you broke that shred of anonymity and realized ""Oh, I'm sitting here arguing with little timmy from down the block.""
* Speaking of breaking shreds of anonymity---not always as hard as you think it is. You can find whole hours long videos of people being found in real life because of these things. Not trying to scare you, really, it's a **large** minority of cases (if it wasn't, a lot of people would be screwed), but doxxing itself is not completely uncommon and is enough to put you in a bad spot. Choose your ""battles"" wisely. 
* It's probably draining your energy and time more than you realize. You can likely observe patterns of lack of satisfaction, no gaining of knowledge or new, *worthwhile* perspectives and opening up your notifications more than usual to be able to respond with another insult or counterpoint. Just because it's the internet, doesn't mean being yelled at by several people isn't draining.",2023-02-06 23:03:47,1675724627

nosurf,Trying to let go the regret from wasting 2 years in a fandom,"I had never gotten sucked into a fandom before, at least not to the level I experienced over the past couple of years. I was in a small but very enthusiastic fandom and ran a couple of fan spaces myself. I didn't realize how toxic the fandom was until the haze lifted and I got out.

I'm a writer and the show I was a mega-fan of does have a great story. I jumped in on the fandom because I thought I could connect with others to analyze story and character details and things like that. But for the most part, that's not really what a fandom does.

Throughout my participation in the fandom, I did recognize toxic behaviors and individuals and avoided them. But still, once I got some perspective, the whole thing is pretty toxic. I'm ashamed to say that people in this fandom defended things like a popular ""non-canon"" ship that was borderline pedophilia or possibly outright pedophilia (basically the age of the younger character couldn't be verified and there was a large age gap, and people would split hairs about the age of the younger character). I distanced myself from those individuals, but most of the fandom didn't think much of this ambiguous age gap and readily associated with the people who were fans of this ship, and in turn, I was associating with those people. In retrospect, I should've noped out when I saw the pattern. There were other toxic traits, but that was the most disturbing.

While I met some people who seemed very nice and were fun to chat with, of course these friendships weren't real. But between the investment in these parasocial friendships and with the media itself, I spent vast amounts of time online, surfing and scrolling for the tiniest tidbit of new information to share with others. I didn't register how competitive the fandom was or how silly it was to be competitive about a TV show that we had nothing to do with creating.

I had never spent more time online or on social media in my life. Being in the fandom not only made me spend too much time online with the fandom stuff, but also caused me to surf compulsively in general. I also watched way too much streaming, not only that show, but compulsively binge-watching other things simply because surfing and watching (often at the same time) had become automatic. 

I quit twitter several months ago, and even that helped immensely. But I was still exposed to the things people were fighting about on twitter and all the weird ass-kissing of the fans who were considered to be ""leaders"" of the fandom. I just started to put together how silly it was to waste hours upon hours with these people and the things they were doing. At some point, the show itself failed to have any significance at all in the fandom; it was mostly about fighting about ships or storylines that people were upset about.

Then I dropped my streaming services--all of them. The pressure I'd been feeling dropped immediately. Having the streaming services made me compulsively watch TV all day when I wasn't working, if nothing else, having it on in the background. I also felt less drawn to the fandom since I wasn't invested in the streaming services any longer, which I felt compelled to use as often as possible in order to feel that I was getting a good value out of paying for them.

I'd like to note that I don't think that streaming services are inherently evil or bad. Of course there's a lot of great content out there. For me, there was too much great content. Like how some people end up compulsively overusing certain platforms, for me it was video streaming. I'm sure at some point I'll use them again in some capacity, but for now I'm satisfied with watching the things I own, and I've been reading and writing more.

Anyways, now I'm dealing with this haze of regret, since the past 2 years of my life revolved around this fandom. The pandemic, of course, did not help and I think a lot of people are in a similar position right now from getting too sucked into something during the weirdness of the pandemic. 

I'm still working on getting my brain back after so much overuse of social media and streaming, and I'm trying to be patient with the withdrawal process.",2023-02-06 15:20:13,1675696813
nosurf,What do you think is the reason ‘this generation doesn’t go out anymore’?,"My partner and I were having a relaxing night in on Friday night after a hard week’s work, and my mom calls and chats, asks us what we are doing, I tell her “oh we’re just watching some movies and having a night in”

And she immediately chimes in with “oh your generation is so different, no one goes out anymore. We used to work full time and then party all weekend back in my day”

And to some degree I understand this, but I wonder if technology is to blame for being easy entertainment without actually going out and partying and having a fulfilling life?

nosurf,my internet addiction...,"Today is my cake day  🍰  and I've been on this platform for one year now.
Actually I've been for way longer, but more as a lurker rather than actually participating.  

But this year made me realise that I have a problem.
I mean I realised this before but it's suprisingly easy to distract yourself from uncomfortable facts and just 'live' on.
I've been on the internet since quite early and was always drawn towards participating  in as many ways as possible.
It started with forums, then early forms of social media, messangers (icq, msn), online games and then it got really intense when Facebook showed up.

Since then I had ups and downs where I was sometimes able to get a grip and just avoid the internet for a while. But that never lasted for very long. I've been in a constant longing for interaction online, collecting internet points, seeking affirmation and chasing those little highs you get when you get a notification. It had become an addiction.

I've never been very lonely and there are people around me who do care about me, but I've noticed I have become more and more distant and less willing to actually interact with human beings. It is hurtful for me and I'm sure also for my friends and family.
But it somehow feels a lot more tiring and difficult to interact in real life. And it isn't as easily rewarding.
I do know  that on the long term real social interactions are the ones that actually make you happy and that they are what you need. I have seen the movies about social media and read quite a lot on it, but it still feels so difficult to take a break.

My screen time goes up and over 8 hours a day sometimes. 
Might be the problem that I was studying and therefore had no real structure in my life, but even in a job it's easy to check your phone every 3 minutes. I still manage to do the bare minimum.  But I feel like I would be so much more able if I could get rid of the distractions.

I tried the apps where you should enable yourself to focus. I even got a time lock to lock away my devices for some time  and that works. But you have to actually use them and thats where it gets difficult again. I sometimes feel like I don't really want to quit. But what more has to happen for me to actually have the willpower to quit.
I feel helpless and weak.

I will try to use my cakeday as an opportunity to quit for a relevant time. Haven't really made a plan yet  but I will uninstall reddit and some other apps, change my password, block some websites and probably will try to uphold this for at least one month.
But what will stop me from wasting my time on a different website? How can I prevent myself from sabotaging me further? How can I achieve a turning point. I have no idea yet. But I have to figure it out. If I can't get a hold of myself, I am lost.

I hope others might see this and check their own relationship to the internet.
I also hope you wish me luck ;) I need it.

If you have amazing tips on how to do it, feel free to share 
I know that finding a different purpose is useful  but that's easier said then done. Going to the gym will only take away so much time of your day. And who doesn't take their phone with them.
Asking yourself what you want to be in 10 years is also not really working. Course I want to be a better person and get things done, but will I actually put the effort in to achieve this? As far as I can see, no.

Also 'easy' fixes like leaving my phone at home, haven't worked yet. Or maybe a day or two, but I always found an excuse to take it with me again. I feel like a real addict (I probably am) and I feel like I'm not the only one with that problem.

Make sure to make yourself aware of that problem and also make other around you aware before it's too late. It feels really really shite.

Have the best of days and chase your goals. You deserve it 👏

nosurf,This is how my day working from home looks like," So, It's 8 in the morning, I have all day. I'll plan on sending the document for work at 8 in the evening, cool. If I work for 4 hours straight, I can do it nicely and I end up with a lot of extra time. So time to procrastinate. Wait, is it already 12 noon? Oh, I should probably start. But I still have 8 hours, I should be able to do that. I'll read the news one last time and then go for it. Wow, this is an interesting article, I have to read it. There might be some interesting info in there. Something tells me I just absolutely need to know that for the future. It may even be useful for work someday, so why not. That's why I have to read it right now.

I start reading the article and halfway through I realize that it would be a good idea to do a quick check up on reddit, internet forums, ig and other websites. Then I get mad at myself, put on a song and get down to business. I start working on the document, do a few clicks of the mouse and then I get the feeling like I'm doing pretty well and my pace is good, so that means I deserve to read askreddit for a while.

Then I go feed my kitties. Suddenly it is two o'clock in the afternoon. Then I'll finally finish reading the article I started reading two hours ago. Then I check twitter, youtube and reddit again. Then an unpleasant OCD intrusive thought creeps into my head and I start to solve it and ruminate over it. So suddenly it's neither workcrastination, nor fun procrastination, but a cheap succumbing to OCD, which steals another half hour from me. Then I get an idea for a reddit poll. Then I check the results and listen to the songs at the same time.

Then it strikes me that it's already 4 in the afternoon and I can't work 4 hours straight to finish the work by 8. I know, I can't work for several hours at a time. And the whole day that I had at the beginning, I've completely wasted until now. I was supposed to start at eight in the morning and spread the work out. Oh boy, how lovely that would have been. But it's too late now, another fail. I screwed up again. Now I have 4 hours to do it and I already know I wont be able to. In addition, the 4 hours that it takes to do this were just an estimate, and I realize that in order for the work to be really good, I would need to work on it longer than 4 hours.

4 hours of continuous work in my case equals to about 8 hours of real time, at best. So I could be done by midnight. It no longer matters whether I send the document at midnight or early in the morning the next day. I can't make it at 8 p.m. anyway, so who cares. Okay, so I'll send it in the morning, okay? Great, I bought all night.

But I've been awake since 8 in the morning, I'll be sleepy in the evening... No, there are people who have been able to stay awake for three days or more, and I wouldn't last for mere 24 hours? Please, I will stay awake all night and sleep in the morning. It'll mess up my sleep schedule, but that's okay. Especially if I send the work in the morning, right? Nice, it's five o'clock in the afternoon and the new work schedule is to work without sleeping until the morning of the next day.

I cleverly bought myself a lot of time now. It's 5 p.m., so how about starting at 8 in the evening and wasting time until then? After all, I will have all night until morning.

Okay, I'll be up all night. I'll probably have to cook something to have enough food to get me through this all-nighter. I will need a lot of food. And I need to go to a store too to buy some drinks to wash it down with. And maybe some sweets.

Hey, it's eight p.m., time to start. I have food and drinks, I have everything I need. But how about opening the news articles and reading one while I eat the food? It'll only take 10 minutes at most. Then I'll start working.

Wow, I had so much food. I'm going to lie down. Hmmm, what about looking at ig? I haven't been there in a few hours. Okay, done. Now I'll check some subreddits, to see what's new. Hey, and how about watching some porn?

Hey, it's 10:30 p.m.. I'm now actually going to work. As I promised I would.

Hmm, I'm getting tired and sleepy. I won't make it all night. I mean I would probably would if I had to. But it's not that important to turn the work in the morning. Staying up all night like a zombie for that would be pretty shitty. I'll be sleepy, I won't focus on it, I'll fall asleep on it. I'd rather get a good night's sleep, get up earlier, and start fresh. After all, I can send the work document tomorrow in the afternoon too.

Okay, I'll set the alarm to 4 in the morning. That way I can get enough sleep and at the same time start early in the morning.

The alarm goes off at 4 a.m. the next day and I shut it and continue to sleep. I get up by myself at 7:30. Okay, morning hygiene. Cleaning my room after yesterday. I'm sitting down at my computer.

So, It's 8 in the morning, I have all day. I'll plan on sending the document for work at 8 in the evening, cool. If I work for 4 hours straight, I can do it nicely and I end up with a lot of extra time.",2023-02-06 12:14:31,1675685671

nosurf,I practically wasted my childhood on the Internet,"I'm a Gen Z kid, recently turned adult, and I grew up on the Internet. I feel like absolute shit whenever I think of all of the precious time I have wasted here, but there's really no way I could have escaped social media.

As a kid, I was fairly isolated. I grew up in a busy area filled with cars, but very limited public transportation, so I wasn't allowed outside alone. And my family didn't have enough money at the time to be able to pay for fancy extracurricular lessons, so the result was, once I got home from school, I was basically locked inside the house. Where else could I have turned to, if \*not\* the Internet?

I used to be a huge bookworm, but once I discovered the Internet everything was over. I had unlimited access, of course, since noone in my family knew what kind of trash I could find here. I started from harmless Flash games, but eventually ended up scrolling through shitty meme sites, like 9gag and iFunny, but the final nail in the coffin was when I ended up on Reddit and 4chan. My biggest regret is how I let my young brain be molded by the absolute insane opinions that are on places like this. I had also seen too many things at an age where I shouldn't even have had a concept of them that are completely disgusting and very damaging, especially for a child.

I recognised what the problem was fairly early on, but I could never manage to do anything about it. I tried every method I could think of, but at the end of the day, I had nothing to do instead of mindlessly browsing the Internet, so I turned back every single time. I can't even express how angry and regretful and hopeless I am that I was allowed complete freedom on the Internet at around 8-9 years old. How noone else, but me, saw that I was suffering from an Internet addiction throughout my whole life. Sometimes I really feel like I'm too far gone, that after spending my childhood on the Internet, I'll never be able to quit, but I'm still trying my best to be able to have the life that I could only ever dream of.",2023-02-06 07:56:57,1675670217

nosurf,Replacing Social Media with Letters,"I remember when I first got my cellphone as a gift. I had no interest in it whatsoever. Social media was a foreign concept to me as I watched documentaries on television, was an avid reader and pursued photography as a passionate hobby of mine all without feeling the need to post about it. The years have passed since then and now I feel empty without social media and I realized that although I've felt isolated throughout life, my online presence has become has become a channel for connection that I feel empty without. But that connection lacks authenticity. It's like taking your hobbies, passions, thoughts and interests and throwing them into a void where you occasionally cross paths with one or two other people before fizzling into nothingness. 

I've recently began to ponder writing letters again and I love the mental clarity that comes with along with putting my thoughts onto paper and sharing it, but the only thing preventing me from leaving social media entirely is the ounce of genuine human connection that I get when I cross paths with other artists or creative minds on the web. So I wanted to make this post and ask if anyone would be interested in starting a written correspondence to support each other in our No Surf journey and maybe using this an opportunity to pick up old hobbies or start a new one and have a friend to share it with.

I had noticed over the last 6 months having decreased attention and motivation and was spending more time scrolling through videos in my free time. I want to replace this with something more positive and fulfilling to help me be successful in filling that time but am not sure what. 

For context, I work have a high powered job with a lot of responsibilities and potential stressors. I work 10-11 hours a day, 5 days a week. I go to the gym 3-4 times a week, take daily walks with my dog, watch TV, and read.

I have to be online and have to have these apps/sites up because a large majority of my best friends are people I can only talk to online. I also need to be online to do all of my schoolwork, and my biggest hobby is done on a computer.

nosurf,"Hardcore internet addict here, this is why I spend every waking moment on the internet and this is why I’m here","First of all, withdrawals. The moment I’m not online I’m bored and uncomfortable. I might get anxious, I might get sad, I might get irritable, but surely I’ll get bored and angry that I am wasting my time listening to whoever it is I’m hanging out with.

Second of all, socialising is one big popularity contest that I find shallow to participate it. It’s the way people act that I find depressing. Even in the most enlightened of all groups of people, put men and women together and you’ll see guys trying to shit on other guys in various socially acceptable ways, like banter or whatever. So for me to socialise, I’ll have to engage in boudary setting back and forths with some guys just to keep my status. Which is tiresome, it’s easier to scroll online.

Third of all, I don’t enjoy anything. I will not enjoy cleaning my room, or going to the gym, or going to dance classes, walk in the park, woodworking, painting, football, tennis table, you name it. No, I’m not depressed, I’m just being honest. 


Why I’m here then? Because in theory the aforementioned issues I have with reality is my dopamine receptors being fried. But the fact that there are guys out there in relationships that enjoy socialising but also play video games is just mind boggling to me. Like I know these dudes who play league of legends whenever they can yet they still go to work, to the gym, to parties and to dance meetings even. How are they not addicted to video games? On the days off they would spend 8 hours gaming and binging on weed. 


I’ve tried nosurf many times and each time I lasted no more than a few days. It’s just so hard. Out of boredom I would force myself to socialise and it would make me feel like total shit. 

Anyone relate? Any advice or similar stories?",2023-02-05 16:13:07,1675613587

nosurf,How did people “waste time” before internet?,"Nowadays it feels like you could spend most of your day just scrolling. Whether it’s Tik Tok, Reddit, Youtube, people can just keep refreshing the page and scrolling for hours upon hours. 

Then also too with streaming, people could binge tv shows for hours. There’s hundreds if not thousands of movies and shows, seasons and episodes across all streaming platforms like Netflix, HBO Max, Hulu, Disney+, Prime video, and all the others. I remember reading that back in the 70s there were only like 3 channels on tv, and TV would even stop showing stuff after a certain time until morning. 

We have so many more ways to waste time these days, that it makes me wonder is it the technology’s fault, or can humans just have a natural inclination towards slacking off? Were there slackers back in the 70s/80s? What did they do? The internet is the same place you can find tons of self help, productivity articles and YouTube videos about how to be more productive. Was there all this focus on productivity back in the day or did people not really worry about it? 

I’m wondering what people did to slack or waste their time when there wasn’t so much stuff available that enabled you to do that. The days when you had to rent a movie for a weekend instead of having hundreds available from your couch or when you couldn’t just keep watching TikToks for hours. I say 70s cause I know the 90s had a lot more options for TV like more channels and stuff so I assume people watched a lot of TV. I grew up in the 2000s and that was a lot of what people did then too, plus computers were more becoming a thing and videogames too.",2023-02-05 08:31:53,1675585913

I'm sure there's a lot of people who say once they've quit, it's difficult because they don't know what to do instead. I'm in a similar but not exact boat. I do have other hobbies outside of screen time as well as work to do.

 I know exactly what I would find rewarding and want to do. The problem is none of it is sustainable enough to fill all the time screens are taking up. 

For instance, I want to draw, read, and just get some work done that I've been putting off. But I just can't do these things for even close to as much time as I would stare at a screen. Eventually I get exhausted and need a break. Sitting there doing nothing I guess counts as a break but I can only do that for so long before it's so unpleasant. My brain is just screaming out for something to engage with, but then it's also exhausted from the only options requiring actual effort and focus (even if only a little in some cases).

nosurf,I don’t know how to begin (RuneScape and tv addiction),"I’ve just realised I’ve been addicted my entire life.

I started playing RuneScape when I was 10 years old. Before that I spent my whole weekends and days after school curled up on the couch playing Pokémon blue.

It was a joy and I lived for it. Then RuneScape came along and I replaced those infinite hours with sitting in front of the computer clicking pixels for dopamine spikes.

Not only that, but as soon as I got a laptop for school, the game was on silent and I binged TV series constantly alongside it.

So that began my addiction to using two screens at a time, since I was 12 years old.

I’m still doing it! Except now I’ve got a phone too! So I’m trying to pay attention to three screens at once, not retaining anything from any of them, but being entirely sedated and comfortable at the same time.

It’s like I don’t know how to exist any other way now? To this day, so for 18 years, (I’m about to turn 30), I’ve been in this fugue state where I’m not enjoying the game, not enjoying what’s on tv, but not interacting with the outside world or improving myself because I’m basically comfortably numbed in this digital prison I’ve built.

But I don’t know how to stop? Occasionally I gain motivation and spend a few hours working out, reading, whatever, but I’m always pulled back into these concrete habits. It’s where I feel safe and comfortable, and honestly I don’t even feel like I have the will or desire to stop.

But I want to stop, desperately, I want to build that desire and break these habits. So that RuneScape isn’t the first thing I do in the morning and who I’m saying goodnight to when I go to bed. That I’m not constantly sedating myself with tv and movies that I don’t remember because I barely paid attention!

Please someone! Can I get some advice on how to begin? Thank you ❤️

nosurf,Is there ANY way to make the youtube app to where there are no suggested videos on the home screen?,"The youtube app have has been very practically useful for me in situations where i’m not near a computer so i don’t wish to delete it off my phone 

however, i find all the suggested videos and “shorts” a major distraction when i open the app and sometimes watch a couple and forget what i was meaning to look up.

someone suggested just using the app logged out so the videos aren’t tailored to me, however i like to have all my saved videos handy as they are actually things i’m interested in and have to reference sometimes

i wish there was a very minimalistic, bare bones version of youtube where all that came up was a search box and your personal videos",2023-02-03 20:48:42,1675457322

I used to be able to watch an entire movie at home with my family.

Now I can't. I always get nervous to grab that laptop next to me and browse the internet, or grab that phone and play a game.

Their dopamine release has surpassed that of movie entertainment. My brain has been rewired to not even tolerate watching a movie.

Digital devices have turned us all into ADHD adults, and nobody is doing anything about it. If being entertained is such a torture, imagine trying to focus on doing actual work. Imagine the loss of work hours, the loss of productivity. The devastating effects on the economy. And yet the world is still not alarmed by this fact.",2023-02-03 20:44:34,1675457074

nosurf,Am I seriously addicted to the internet to ask for help?," 

Hi, I'm a girl, age 25 and this is a throaway acc.

I spend hours upon hours online. I stay up late, I run on 4-5 hours sleep max

Everytime something is stressing me out ( like exams) I avoid all my responsibilities and stay online for days on end

I know at this point I am dependent on it, I know I use it to numb my feelings and avoid real life. It's been 5 years. I feel like I am waisting my life

There's brief periods that I do not not spend over 3-4 hours a day , usually last for 10-14 days but normally I spend lot of days during the week like this

It's not that obvious to others that I stay so much online because I will go out with friends or attend some classes. But besides that, I spend my time online

I know if I change my habits or go to a therapist , I have a chance of dealing with my issues and I may need to use it less. I don't think the internet is making me addicted, more like I use it because I need an addiction. But it's becoming a cycle , the more I use it, the more I detach from life

My question is. Is it okay for me to ask for help in self help communities( like 12 steps group therapy etc)? Or should I be experiencing an even worse intensity of these symptoms?

I used to visit a therapist for 2.5 years but I didn't break my habits. I would be very ashamed to ask for help from a setting where people with more serious addictive behaviour than me go. I would feel like I am waisting resources and out of place.

I just don't know if I usethe internet as an excuse to avoid everything and if it's easier than I think to break the habit. I have never seriously tried alone. I find comfort in this lifestyle but ultimately I feel like I am nothing, nobody.",2023-02-03 09:48:28,1675417708

But for the most times I’m just home in my bed with my phone. Sometimes I even spend 12-13 hours on the phone on one day and I’m exhausted after that. I have an iPhone 13 Pro Max which I love and it’s fast and have a big screen. Sometimes I’m thinking of getting an old one where you only can do text messages and calls. But I want to be able to take pictures and listen to music and check my bank account and so on. So I need a smartphone. But how do I stop using social media?

I’ve met hundreds of people in the parkour community, traveled all over the country, visited Canada, Portugal, Spain and the UK, discovered the town I currently live in, and met my awesome partner (via online dating). Social media has allowed me to skip the lonely young adult phase of life.

So this is why I want to get rid of that, but the problem is that I can't, because I follow scientific content creators, I benefit from their content because I love science and astronomy

nosurf,There are a million other things to do but I just don't want to,"The problem for me is not finding other things to do besides surfing. I could be playing instruments, cleaning, reading a book, taking a walk, painting, writing, making music or whatever. I have access to all of those things. But there are still huge chunks of time in the day when I just don't want to do any of those things. There is no desire. They all feel pointless. So I turn to surfing.

When I turn my screens off, all I do is stare at a wall instead. I wish I wanted to do something else. I try to reach into my heart for even the slightest bit of desire to get up and do something else but there is just a void.

Maybe I'm just getting old and nothing excites me anymore? Can I ever get back the feeling of wanting to do something?",2023-02-02 19:42:06,1675366926

\- I have learned that I might be a highly sensitive person and I have started building my daily routine better and doing exercise avoiding caffeine to make myself feel better. 

\- My energy levels went up: I started doing chores I have been postponing with ease and enjoyment. I can feel the difference between a day with/without social media immediately. 

\- My creativity improved. I started getting much much better ideas and seeing better opportunities (that were there all along!).

This addon simply helps you hide all the panels that suggest new content to you, so you can only leave the search bar, to search for the content you need to watch, and nothing else.

Needless to say I spend the better part of the past 2 months sleep deprived just the same, trying to recover with many complications holding me down. 

My focus is gone. I'm trying to watch training videos to get my feet back on the track and able to work again. I can't focus for 10 minutes straight. Always fighting my brain who wants to switch doing more passive stuff, nothing that requires much focus. I can spend hours and hours on this site seeking a small dopamine fix and not get anything done all day. Will I ever get my focus back? I don't want to medicate myself.

nosurf,I feel social media has taken away peoples personalities. An observation by a 23 year old male.,"Over the last few months I’ve deleted a couple of social media apps. Twitter altogether and Instagram I’ve been on and off but it’s hard to delete that as a lot of people message me on there. I’ve never had tik Tok thank god.

There’s been so many times when I’ve been out with my friends at the pub and they’re literally just talking about nothing. They’ll bring up all these weird memes on twitter/Insta/tiktok which are supposed to be funny but I just sit there and pretend to be amused.

I like to spend my free time listening to music a lot, going to the gym and learning to play the guitar. I was a big gamer before but I only play once/twice a week now. 

When I talk about things I like for instance old films or tv programmes I used to watch or music, I find a lot of people I know don’t really listen to anything or watch films. All they do is just mindlessly scroll through social media which is sad to see. 

Every time I suggest new activities my friends always make excuses, and I’ve had a couple people say to me (friends and family) that I’m weird for not having tik tok and I’m trying to be edgy. 

Which just makes absolutely no sense to me. I’ve even had people take the piss out of my music preferences which is kinda weird but if it makes them feel better go for it. 

I’m 23 by the way and this is just an observation of the people I surround myself with. Mainly my friends and cousins up to 10-15 years older than me. If I’m at a family event I tend to find myself talking to older people as they can actually hold good conversations as well have life experiences and stories to tell. 

It just feels everyone’s trying to portray some fake perfect life but I can tell a lot of people I know aren’t happy deep down. I can’t see social media going away or how prevalent it is in todays age. 

I could go on and talk about how bad music/ films are these days but I’ll be here all day.",2023-02-02 11:03:57,1675335837

______________

An extremely fortunate accident, I was all too consumed with my cell phone.

&gt;Bus to school? Reddit

&gt;In class? /r/ AskReddit 

&gt;Walking home? Snapchat

&gt;On the toilet? YouTube

&gt;Driven around by father? Mobile game

&gt;Eating breakfast? Reddit

&gt;Drinking with friends? Snapchat stories!

Every moment of life was interjected by media. Up until 3AM sending Snaps, getting off, losing sleep. Jr-High school.

As a result, I believe I stunted my development during teenage years. I loved my phone and got the latest and greatest at the time Nokia Lumias. 41MP camera?? Yes please! 6.4"" screen? Ecstatic. 

Kept buying the latest and greatest. 3GS, 4G, GTX 670, 680, Lumia 1020, 1520, etc.

And then it broke.

I cracked the screen and damaged the motherboard trying to fix it. Ok I'll order a replacement set of parts and deal without a phone until then. I still have my MP3 player for tunes.

2 weeks passed without the parts.

1 month passed.

&gt; 2 months passed.

Hmm, actually, I'm quite liking this. I don't know what exactly I was liking but a shift was developing. I was still using the internet on my computer, but AFK I was more present.

Slowly but surely those dopamine hits from notification sounds, vibration buzzing, and red (1) icon gently eroded from my mind. I still loved gaming.

Having played online games since 6 years old, gaming was deeply ingrained in me. It consumed thousands of hours and gave so much stress, unbeknownst to me.

From RuneScape in 2005 to TF2, CS:GO, Oculus Rift, Racing Simulators, GTA5, Reality Simulators. Simulators.

&gt; I sold my gaming computer

I bought a real (cheap cheap) car for rally racing. It was incredible. Reality hits different.

&gt; I sold that car

I moved somewhere overseas without a phone and just a laptop. Maps I screenshotted, shopping lists I wrote down, and pictures with a camera. 

I slowly became more and more present whenever I was out and about. When inside my room I was glued to my computer screen, but at least when outside the confines of my apartment I was tech-free (aside from my MP3 player).

I stared out the window on train rides, I asked old ladies for directions, I talked to old men at bus stops (in broken Dutch). They were bewildered how a young person was speaking with them. I did some psychedelics and implemented these changes even deeper. Art. Cooking. Biking. Culture.

&gt;Fast forward to getting a phone again. 

Years later I ended up buying a cheapo $70 phone in an airport while stranded. It was garbage - AliExpress type phone - had the worlds most terrible camera and slow speed. It was perfect! I slowly assembled a library of functional apps such as banking and maps, and it was so shit that I didn't even have storage room for the full FB messenger. A perfect way to ease back into it.

Meanwhile living in different countries, squeezing pennies to milk their value. On a budget but loving it. Start typing for people online and getting paid. Live in Slavic country, make friends, eat sardines, watch crabs, explore water, satiating life.

&gt;Fast forward a couple yrs later

I've bought another $70 phone, this time a second hand 5 years old LG G5 for one purpose - the camera. Damnit if I can't carry around a mirrorless camera everywhere - I'd still love to capture memories.

For 5 years old, it took remarkably incredible photos, runs well, and sees very little screen time. I often went days or even weeks without touching it, using it for 2FA, maps, and a camera. Getting rid of my phone changed my life.

Instead of 8 second stories I posted 3,000 word articles, writing content for other businesses as a freelancer. No longer $5 an hour. Charging $25, $50, $75, $100 for an article. High. Quality. Effort.

&gt; 3 years ago

I cut out pornography and began to use social media as a business venture. Publish videos, reviews, posts under my own domain, not owned by FB, Googl, or whoever.

I got an iPhone 8 thing. Worked really well, didn't crash, took great photos, and made messaging/navigation/communication easier. 

Started developing online business thing more. Started posting more and more. Over 100 articles now. 

&gt; This year

Online business thing is my income. I found nice sunny, warm, safe, cheap, long term place to live. Got iPhone 12 mini - incredible camera. Useful for business. Don't often, think of it. Around 31 min avg phone screen time daily.

Off to Morocco for a month. Sand dunes appeal strongly, as the digital landscapes once did.

Reddit is causing problems in my marriage.  Let me explain.  With a 3 year old boy in our house we both have very minimal free time.  And I mean very little: I have to read at a rate of 400 to 500 wpm to even finish a book a week, which is my goal for the year.  And I can maybe play computer games for an hour or two a week.  

The thing is.  I have this down to a science, where I can finish a book a week, manage to play a few hours of a computer game a week, and still perform my role as a husband and dad.

It is THIS WEBSITE!  That disturbs the balance.  I find myself spending literally hours on here and it is addictive as hell.  Much more addictive than any video game I've ever played.

It will suck out your soul and destroy your life if you let it!  No more.

I choose to be conscious in this life.

So no Reddit for the rest of February and more!",2023-02-02 02:58:08,1675306688

nosurf,I deleted tiktok almost a year ago and now I realise how absolutely toxic and addictive that app is,"I'm still on a journey to quit the internet more (not fully because it is a useful tool when used right) but I didn't realise how addicted to tiktok I was until I quit the app.

When I deleted tiktok my screen time more than halved - I used to have an 8 hour a day screen time some days up to 10 hours if I wasn't working. Just deleting the app it went down to more like 4 hours and with some more work on myself and hobbies I can now look at a 3.5 hour screen time and think that's a lot (it is but compared to my old screen time it's nothing). Today my screen time reads 2.5 hours and I feel like I've spent a lot of time on my phone today (listening to YouTube videos in the background and scrolling twitter far too much more info about twitter for another post one day- not perfect just trying to get better).

I used to take my dog for a walk in an open field where he could run and play - instead of watching his pure joy for life and being in nature I honestly sometimes stop and scroll through tiktok at points to make the walk bearable. It's super embarrassing to admit now but I genuinely thought I wasn't addicted even though I couldn't make it through a walk without checking my phone. Now I just take him for a walk - no ear phones or anything and watch him running and being so happy! It's amazing and the walks feel so good now, I also make them a social thing getting family and friends to come a long on the daily walks when they feel like it and can make it.

I read books now. Big books and small books! I can read for hours at a time - before I couldn't even get through a page.

I can watch TV or movies without checking my phone.

I can leave my phone on one side of the house and do something on the other with my parents (talk to them instead of staring at my screen!)

I have been doing garden work and DIY projects for my mum that she doesn't get around to when I am home alone on the weekends when everyone else is working because I have free time now not just work, tiktok, sleep.

I'm still a screen addict I think and I'd ideally like to get my screen time to less than 2 hours a day, then eventually less than 1 hour a day but my life is 100x more fulfilling now just from deleting tiktok. From my personal experience tiktok was the kryptonite. I know it doesn't work like this for everyone but I'm so much happier now than I used to be. 

I just wanted to share this positive experience and hopefully if you're thinking of deleting tiktok it might give you a push to just do it.",2023-02-01 21:02:57,1675285377
nosurf,"Redditors who are mostly offline, what does your weekly schedule look like?","I'm trying to reorganize my weeks so I don't look at my computer after work. Consuming social media or video content all the time is just starting to make my brain feel scrambled, and I don't want to keep doing it.

I'd like to live a life mostly offline from now on and shift my computer usage mostly towards work. Right now my weeks consist of working between 9 and 6 and then going to the gym. Tonight I'm going to shake things up by going to my fav local coffee shop after the gym to read until they close at 10. But I'm looking for other suggestions so I can try more new things.

nosurf,I'm signing out of my account today for the last time.,"I've been trying to step back from the internet, but my account has been reported several times now so I'm taking that as a cosmic sign or whatever. It's time to leave Reddit.  


A word of warning: never ever ever involve yourself in internet drama. It's not even a little bit worth it. Real discussions can't happen because every single little thing you say or do will be picked apart and analyzed. You say one wrong, bad, or contradictory thing (even if it was accidental/said in haste), and suddenly you are the worst most vile person that's ever walked the earth - even if you sincerely apologize over and over again. I don't care how much research you've done on both sides of whatever rabbit hole situation you're swept up in... it is not worth it in the end.  


I feel light as a feather walking away from all of that dramatic and frenzied energy. I am logging out of this account, and you will not see another post from me on Reddit.   


I'll leave you with this: even if it's cold out, get outside and deeply inhale some outdoor air, notice how nice the sunshine feels on your skin, pet your dog/cat, read a good book, have some coffee and play a card game with a friend in real life. Feel gratitude for the smallest of things. Feel gratitude that you can have a real and meaningful life when you aren't so checked out of it by being on your phone 24/7.  


The people that stay in internet drama? They might never have that... and I'm sure I'm not alone when I say that I feel truly sad for them.

nosurf,"I have a crippling social media addiction, and I don't know how to approach it because of school","I have always naturally been a neophile (lover of new things/information). I first had unrestricted internet access at 11, and now at 18 I am on academic probation in my first year because I can't study, I need stimulation, and nothing is as stimulating as the next youtube short or wikipedia article or the next page of reddit posts, so how can I do anything else? If I had a choice, I'd throw away all my devices and never touch one again. I know I'd be happier and more fulfilled. But as anyone who has recently had a job or gone to school knows, it is not possible to study or turn in assignments without them. I know there are ways I could cut down, start printing all of my readings. Shell out $400 each for physical textbooks. Cut off all my loved ones and friends. Drop out of college. I may also have undiagnosed ADHD, I have impulsive behaviors and pathologically avoid everything I don't want to do, among many other things. Sometimes I even find myself clicking on something for the sake of the dopamine hit and then clicking off because I wasn't actually interested in it. I have been this way for at least 5 years and have considered suicide many times. In high school I found myself losing touch with reality, having terrifying derealization/depersonalization episodes. To be fair, I have always denied it, I couldn't admit that my dad is right and I am in fact a pathetic child with no self control. I know if I brought this to a therapist or a recovery meeting no one would take me seriously. I truly have no one to blame but myself.",2023-02-01 12:15:00,1675253700

i can't remember the last time i took a picture with anything except the occasional intentional film camera (so very slow gratification) which is something that naturally happened. i have been doing so many cool things but honestly i don't need to preserve the memories in digital picture form. journal-writing &amp; art-making took its place largely. things become more precious.

nosurf,Opinions on the internet,"Does anyone feel like that on (certain parts of) the internet you are pressured to have a developed opinion on anything and everything? Every book you read you need an essay written on or you didn't *truly* understand it, even if it's just something you wanted to sit back and enjoy without much thought in the first place?  

On the other hand, most people's opinions aren't actually their own? You'll see two people auguring over a movie on here and then one admits ""well, I haven't personally watched it..."" 

Or people have the mindset often that their opinion is objectively the correct one with no room for people simply having different experiences or tastes? They may be able to act fine with other opinions but, it's obvious they don't actually try seeing it from other perspectives or accept it. 

I'm guilty of some of it too. How much stuff could I possibly have liked over the years but wrote it off because a youtuber made a video saying it's bad? Or the vice versa, of acting like I enjoyed or got into something because everyone else had, and I could be legitimately harassed or asked to fork over an explanation as to why if I say I just personally didn't enjoy it. It sounds like it should all be exaggeration, but I've seen and/or gone through this all countless times. 

And don't get me wrong, even in history you had people passionately (to put it nicely in some cases) arguing over the Greek epics. But the current state of the internet just makes it a whole other beast that I simply don't see in real life conversation---besides maybe with insane sports fans or particularly out there people. And at least in those cases their opinion is at least from actually watching hours of the games because it's something they genuinely care about. Even if in the worst way possible...

Sod it. The internet is making me way too angry. Today was way too freeing (massively cut back online).

From now on, if I use socials, it's on my laptop. The socials I'll use for posting are: Space Hey and Reddit (not for everything just for here &amp; retro subs &amp; AskUK). The socials I'll use for reading are online forums (if there is a game literally on &amp; only available via the radio, I will go on a sport forum to read what people are saying because I don't know if I have the patience to just listen to the radio on its own anymore) and Youtube (again, only nice positive videos mostly nostalgia content &amp; only if there is nothing on Sky Arts/Challenge when I want background noise for my art). I'll hold off from using them until I have done everything I intended to.

My SpaceHey is a sports &amp; politics free zone. I want to make it all about the things that make me happy without having a group rivalry element to them. I want it to be happy rather than angry. I will only post on it if I have finished everything &amp; it's between a certain time of the day (ie too late to go out, too early to start my evening).

I would like to make these next six months the best of my life, but do not know how.I am a Christian and I believe I need to trust in God more, and to stop trying to find “the right productivity system.”

I have spent extensive time on writing about my past and future plans (Jordan Peterson’s self-authoring suite) but I still doubt and want to pursue the right thing.
I was diagnosed with depression after a traumatic breakup, (I did self-harm) and I am taking 50mg of sertraline and seeing a Christian therapist who is a female…

Additionally, I am a senior at Whitman College and am currently in the research phase for my thesis on the politics of technology and internet addiction. I am looking for advice and insight through short interviews with really anyone who cares about this subject and wants to talk to me (you do not have to identify as a technology “addict”).

I am interested in discovering the ways that technology and internet dependence, and attention commodification impacts things like school, work, and political participation, as well as how technological power structures impact our connections to eachother, ourselves, and our environment. Volunteering as one of my interviewees would benefit an underdeveloped academic field that will become increasingly important in the next decades. I believe that having conversations about internet use and the large social and political dynamics surrounding it will also be highly beneficial to the community of people struggling with technology overuse. No deception is involved in my study, and I have no particular political aim. My goal is to create a paper that listens to and engages with what those actively seeking solutions to technology overuse have to say. 

If you are interested in spending approximately an hour talking to me about your perspective on the social and political aspects of these things, please reach out to me via direct message.",2023-01-30 21:01:33,1675112493

But I’m mostly offline social media, still have my accounts but they aren’t a crutch and I don’t waste time on them anymore, check maybe once a week.

My biggest issue is texting friends and snap chatting friends (I don’t use the stories side of Snapchat, just for group chats and sending funny videos to friends)

I feel like there is this stigma that we have to constantly text our friends, be up to date with everything they’re doing, where they are, etc. or else you’re not close and you’ll lose touch with them.

I find that entirely untrue because I love my friends but I don’t just sit and wait for them to text me, I have lost friendships because I was the only one putting in the effort to try and see them whereas they only texted me, I’m not a fan of texting and I just save my stories and catch up for in person.

nosurf,Doing a social media detox for the month of February. Who is interested in joining?,"Some of you probably noticed by now that I've been doing these detoxes each month since last October and might be wondering why. 

I don't think I'll be letting go of social media as I've tailored it to be something useful but my aim is to have a controlled, strict and casual relationship with it where I won't addictively binge on it or use it as a means to escape reality and curbing boredom.

I believe I have an addictive personality where I'm susceptible to forming addictions and social media has been the longest and strongest addiction I've had so it's been difficult trying to establish a balance with my usage of it but I feel like I'm almost there.

Anyway, my plan for the detox is written below and you can modify it to your needs. I know my plan will feel like it's incomplete and that there's things missing so add your suggestions. 

I'd also welcome updates in the comments at the end of the month or however long your detox lasts for.

 

**The Rules:**

&amp;#x200B;

* Use only the social medias that have a necessary function such as for work/business or communication and turn off notifications for the rest. 
* Entertainment like TV shows, movies and anime are allowed but restraint must be exercised to avoid binging on them in spare time.
* Avoid deleting apps or using blockers if you can to be able to sit with the urge/impulse of logging in and understand/reflect on what the psychological source of it is. Practice letting the urge/impulse pass on its own without giving in to it. 
* Unless your computer/laptop, tablet or phone must be used for work, keep screen time to  a minimum and do not mindlessly wander around the web looking for something else to replace social media.

 

**What to do with spare time:**

&amp;#x200B;

* Allow boredom to be felt and change it into a practice of stillness, self-reflection and being present. Do not fight or resist boredom. It's your chance to do things differently.
* Do the things that have been neglected to get done from squandering time on social media.
* Structure each day with something to do with your friends, family or just yourself. It's okay if it's not as exciting as using social media.
* Start working on a new skill that your mind can be preoccupied with.
* Pick up activities that require effort and have a slow reward such as reading books to condition your brain to have less resistance to doing ""hard things"".
* Practice meditation during times where urges are strong and to help the frontal lobes strengthen executive function
* Go outside whenever the weather permits if in cold climate. 
* Journal what's on your mind, especially when reflecting on your own social media addiction and what emotional needs social media is unhealthily fulfilling for you or what emotions you are suppressing and masking with it. 
* Learn what your relationship to social media is and be honest with yourself about why you use it.

&amp;#x200B;

 **Staying accountable (Wasn't sure how to answer this before and still kind of don't):**

&amp;#x200B;

* Find someone (in real life or online) that is willing to do the detox with you and keep each other accountable.
* ????
* (Need suggestions for staying accountable)

 

**What to do when feeling triggered/tempted:**

&amp;#x200B;

* Allow the temptation/urge to pass, because it eventually will.
* Figure out the mental and emotional source of your temptation/urge.
* Walk away from your phone, tablet, computer or laptop.
* Remind yourself why you're doing the detox and what you're looking to overcome.
* Do not make excuses and catch them when they arise.
* Avoid placing yourself in situations where urges are likely to be triggered.

&amp;#x200B;

**What to do after detox is done:**

&amp;#x200B;

* Decide if there are social medias that are of little use to you that you wish to permanently delete. 
* Establish a time limit for how long you can use social media for (ex: 1 or 2 hours) and when. Do NOT exceed the limit. 
* Figure out a schedule for when you can use social media and at what time of the day.
* *Optional: Make social media a reward of leisure for doing a long day of work or tasks instead of a random activity you can easily access*

&amp;#x200B;

 

**The social medias I will be detoxing from (most to least addictive):**

&amp;#x200B;

* Twitter 
* Reddit 
* Facebook 
* Youtube 
* Instagram",2023-01-30 02:35:57,1675046157

nosurf,What social media is doing is going to hit this generation like a train when they get older,"There is a lot of discussion about how social media is increasing political polarization and potentially causing a rise in mental health issues, but that’s not what this post is about.

Anyone who has tried detoxing from social media has noticed, time feels much slower without it. Or in other words, time feels faster when on social media.

Social media is consuming more and more of our lives. And it makes the quality of your life offline worse, as it hurts your attention and gives a warped perspective of your life as everyone else’s highlight reels is shoved in your face.

Midlife crisis were always a phenomenon, but I can’t imagine how bad it’s going to be for the kids who spend so much time online. They will look back at their lives and most of it will be a blur.",2023-01-30 00:26:04,1675038364
nosurf,The well is poisoned.,"Many of us surf for comfort. But how fucked up is that. What never fails to agitate me more than anything else? What never fails to disturb any sense of calm or focus I've ever had? Surfing. So why do we keep going back to the well if we know it's poisoned? Sometimes I feel such a strong pull to use, but it makes no sense. It's really akin to being on a merry-go-round and begging anyone nearby to keep spinning you. In reality, what we need more than anything else is some solid ground, some space, some quiet, and some time to heal our minds. 

What is something you are doing to find solid ground? I'd love to hear. Thanks for reading.",2023-01-30 00:04:25,1675037065

Going all or nothing on this is never gonna work in my case, maybe it will for others.

I think it's more about starting to pay attention to surfing habits, be more mindful of where time is wasted, but also where useful internet habits occurs &amp; try to shift the balance so at least it weighs slightly more on the useful side.

Also, with lowsurf vs nosurf it should be easier to find non-internet based activity to fill the extra time with since it'll only be for like half the day vs a full day of time to fill.

This is just what I think might help me. Everyone's got different aims &amp; goals to deal with their internet addctions. I do like the general vibe of 'lowsurf' though, I think I might stick with that vs the more hardlined sounding 'nosurf'.",2023-01-29 23:15:32,1675034132

nosurf,"Forgive, but don't forget.","When you fall down the rabbit hole, how do you get back up? If you're like me, perhaps you tell yourself, ""Today I can't do anything about, but tomorrow will be different. Tomorrow I will do XYZ"". Well, it's a pretty shit strategy in my experience. After you sleep and wake up, what is the likelihood you will remember your convictions? And also, making goals for tomorrow is another form of procrastination, which is the reason many of us surf. It's really just empty promises, a way for us to placate ourselves. Personally, there is usually very little continuity from the night before to the morning after if I'm in a bad way. I'm so caught in the present it's likely I won't remember the convictions I made, or how awful I felt during and after use. For the last ten years, I've been in an endless game of Snakes and Ladders, going up and down constantly. I think this because I forget the lessons of yesterday all too easily. If I go back and read my journal from the past 2-3 years, I'll find the same things over and over again. There's been no permanent progress.

As it's the morning now for me, I've had a thought which prompted this post. I believe it's very important to set intentions and be mindful first thing in the morning. Every sleep is like a mental reset. To make progress and have continuity between the days, there needs to be some sort of reflection present in your life. Whether it's journaling, meditation, thinking, talking, or some other form, I think we just need to keep the conversation going (to steal a phrase). I think it's important to remember how we feel during and after use, why we feel that way, and what our other choices are going forward. I don't think this exercise should be about self-loathing though. It should be about honesty, realism, and progress. 

We need to forgive ourselves. But we must never forget.",2023-01-29 15:28:58,1675006138

nosurf,How does being an 'iPad kid' affect your brain and life long-term?,"An iPad kid is someone whose been glued to the internet since infancy by parents that think iPads are parenting substitutes. I was born just before the advent of YouTube so I wasn't affected much, I don't even have a phone. But a lot of my younger relatives have never been without a tablet since they were born and screech whenever it was taken away. It's part of a wider range of issues with Gen Z imo.

I'm in high school currently and one thing I've noticed about iPad kids is a dive in behaviour from previous years. We were annoying as kids but never to this extent. We at least knew how to say please and thank you and hold a conversation. Those born in 2010 are now teenagers (existential dread) so they've begun terrorizing everyone.

They have zero social or practical skills, they talk as if they were in a YouTube video. They set fires routinely, get into fights nonstop, scream at random people in the corridors and break into the exam halls. It was nothing like this a few years back. The teachers have noticed it too, they think it's a combination between Internet addiction and the COVID lockdowns. When you've spent two years ""learning"" online with no social interaction beyond a computer screen it's no surprise.

The garbage they watch is mind-numbing too. They'll stare at it blankly for hours upon hours like zombies. Elsagate is the most infamous controversy surrounding online kids' content. It's insane that this is what kids are raised with nowadays. No imagination, no creativity, no learning, no socializing, just straight-up garbage.

How long will it be until we start seeing a large percentage of adults incapable of basic human tasks? Millennials are already struggling as is so I can't imagine how much of a disaster it'll be once Gen Z takes the helm.",2023-01-29 10:34:42,1674988482

2.  I can focus better on reading, and my writing becomes much better. 

3. I think I have more mental resources for other things. It feels as if keeping constant watch on social media apps paralyses me mentally which makes me less dispose to do more important things.

Please help me.,"I have tried to quit before and I could do it for maybe 5-6 hours but after that I feel so drained like I ran a marathon or something and I loose all willpower and just feel extremely anxious and depressed, almost feeling like I'm going to have a panic attack.

I tried both moderating and going cold turkey but can't even go for one full day, I didn't go a single day without spending most of the day on the internet or video games for the last 8 years and as a result don't have a single friend at 19 years of age and have finished high school with horrible grades because most of the time I would rather pretend that I'm study and then browse my phone because I couldn't just sit and read a book for 30 minutes or, God forbid, more than that.

I have time until spring to fix myself and by then I need to be able to study for many multiple a day for college.

What should I do?

Do you guys have some reading material you would recommend for me or just have some advice on how I should go about this to make this process easier? My goal would be to be able to surf for only 1-2 hours a day and then go do something actually productive.

p.s. I have painful ingrown toenails at the moment so going outside won't be an option for some time.

nosurf,Cautionary Warning - Posted about my time away from the internet the other day here and now I'm having a severe breakdown since returning!!,"Hey everyone! Just letting you know to be mindful while browsing here. I wanted to share my results and I did but behind the scenes I immediately started engaging in really bad behaviors with this return:

 * Went from a stable sleep schedule (10-12) to staying on laptop until 2 AM
* Stopped doing anything else in my leisure time besides internet
* Completely isolated from social safety net (friends and family)
* Stopped going to social events I regularly went to
* Flaked on a new club I wanted to join
* Flaring agoraphobia (not sure if this is a bad way to say this, I don't have clinically diagnosed agoraphobia or anything. I have social anxiety and I notice that it seems it can veer into agoraphobia if it gets severe in a ""overlapping features with depression"" kind of way, like not leaving apartment that grows into not leaving room) 
* Had a really severe emotional breakdown over minor stressful event, to the point of repeatedly considering self harm/ideation (I didn't do anything and I won't because I'll send myself to the hospital first, but yeah it got that bad!)

I hate all of this, I didn't chose this in any way and yet here I am. I just wanted to share this in all honesty, and so that you guys are aware that what you see here is heavily biased. Reddit is a social media site and obviously I am a special case of someone going from 0 - 100 but keep in mind addiction can be really complicated and the sources you get your information or advice from. I'm not any source of authority, and neither are the people here, but additionally **you're not alone** and our society may be sick with this very pervasive new unspoken behavioral/psychological technology addiction. It's very real. 

I think a lot of my emotional upset right now is due to feeling isolated/lonely/alone, so I want to emphasize for others suffering, **this is very difficult and you are strong for at minimum having the recognition of this issue, even if people close to you are not supportive**. Change takes time and even if I'm in pain right now if I pick myself back up from this then even if people don't understand I *will* have a better future for having made the change.",2023-01-28 23:03:01,1674946981
nosurf,What is even the point of having a personal page on social media?,"I feel that since social media became a popular and prevalent, many people joined in without really considering the point of making a social media profile. 

I saw a post a few years back saying that there really is no point having an instagram account unless you are an influencer/content creator, an artist or a marketer trying to reach as many audience as possible. That really stuck with me. This thought is further solidified when my prof told me it might be a good idea to make an academic/professional twitter account for networking. 

I deactivated my main instagram and twitter accounts before Covid, on which I followed many people from high school, acquaintances I’ve met a few times at uni, etc. I was not really interested in their posts, and it would give me anxiety knowing that these people, who I am not even close to, are in my online space. I created another Instagram mainly to follow contents I am interested in (due to it being photo-based). For example, I am really into architecture, interior design, mid-mod furniture, photography of specific styles, nature, and music. I follow mainly accounts that post their original contents on these topics, as well as only a handful of close friends and internet friends I’ve connected with because of these interests. As for twitter, I followed mainly academic accounts in my field, as well as some of my profs and their labs. I set both accounts to private. 

I would not even call my accounts “personal pages,” they are more like places where I can gather/keep up with relevant info that matches my interests. I used to post some of my own creative works too, and stuff that I found interesting, but never really any personal/daily-life stuff. 

As I made more irl friends post-lockdown, I have been getting increasing requests from acquaintances to follow my social media. I would always get very anxious afterwards, and feel less comfortable posting my creative ideas and interests. I would feel that I have to post pics of social gatherings, basically all the highlights from my life—which I don’t even see the point of—like most people I’ve met irl do. Whenever I saw those kinds of posts from them, unless we are actually close, I’d get FOMO and even feel jealous. Under so much scrutiny from irl acquaintances, I would also feel an increased need to perform/mask myself to create an online persona, which negatively affects my mental health.

I think I will make two accounts: a creative one that is mainly interests-based where I feel the most comfortable and remain active, and a personal page which I will barely use, where I can post some highlights in my life just to fit in with the norm. I would direct new ppl I meet in real life to follow me on the personal page. 

I guess I just don’t really see the point of having an account where you post social gatherings and other highlights. I do take photos with my friends and save them to my phone, but I don’t see the point of posting them. Once in a while I’d end up taking a really good photo of a place, a scenery, or a building when I’m out, and I’d post it solely because it’s good photography.",2023-01-28 21:38:43,1674941923

Even a full 8 hours off the tech while I sleep isn’t enough to recover from the strain, and when I wake up it’s a massive challenge not to grab my phone as the first thing I do.

(2) I tend to **overthink when a friend \*seens\* my message**, even when they *don't have an obligation* to reply to me immediately,  
(3) I don't know how to react when a person leaves the group chat I created (should I reach out cuz they might be offended if I don't or should I ignore and keep the peace for both of us??)

I used to spend countless time on online forums, bonding with fellow misfits across oceans, it was our haven, and that is the past now. Those forums died, the connections didn't last, and life went on. We went on, in our respective, different worlds. And now it's not weird to be online anymore, and everyone and their grandparents are here, and it's aggressive, and competitive, and loud, and snarky, and political, and always 'on' here. And it's such an endlessly tiring cacophony that is so easy to be drowned out in. You want to feel like what you do, share, have to say, matters, and I used to feel like that online, but now it's just not really... enough?

I feel like, why not just start a podcast with my ideas (because I keep getting these ideas, and I'm like, I know, I'll start a community, but there are so many wider ways I can do that that will actually matter and reach wider audiences)?

nosurf,Has anyone else quit TV/streaming?,"I've been without social media (except Reddit, obviously) for about a week now. It hasn't been too terrible, but that's because I've just replaced it with watching TV/streaming services. This wasn't my intention at all.

(To clarify, when I say ""TV"" I'm referring to all forms of cable, movies, streaming, etc.)

I quit social media because I don't want to have regrets about wasting time on my phone when I'm on my death bed, but now I'm worried I'm just wasting my life away on TV. I've quit vaping, weed, porn, social media, and am tapering off caffeine- and somehow, quitting TV seems WAY harder than quitting the rest of these things COMBINED. I feel like I'm using the same justifications I used on all my other addictions to avoid having to give up TV. I've tried limiting how and what I watch and replacing it with other activities, but I truly feel like an addict because I just don't have any self-control whatsoever. It's a constant vicious cycle of me staying in bed watching TV, which makes me depressed, which makes me watch TV, which makes me more depressed, so I watch more TV......... etc.

I'm going to be moving at the beginning of March, and then I'll be temporarily staying with family for about two months before I permanently move again. I was considering just quitting TV altogether until then (about 3 months from now) and then when I move I can decide how much I want to let TV back into my life.

**below is just stuff that has made me wonder if i had adhd:**

* always feel like i have to study so much more than my peers to get the same result, and for classes that don't interest me as much, i literally spend so much time studying and even try to focus in class but i literally keep failing tests and everyone else gets A's and B's
* literally almost never have any motivation to do any work whatsoever, and then random bursts of energy where i get stuff done. like even right now i'm procrastinating a lot of work i have to do
* super super fidgety. always doing something to keep me busy
* i don't know how to relax, i can't even just watch tv without doing something else at the same time
* have a very bad habit of accidentially interrupting people when they're not doing talking even in IMPORTANT MEETINGS that has literally made me hate myself and feel so so embarassed
* horrible memory. can't even finish saying a sentence without forgetting what i'm saying and going back
* i get lost everywhere, at school, my neighborhood, everything
* forget everything all the time and lose my stuff  

   * still haven't found my wallet which i know is in my house, but i keep forgetting to look for it
   * i literally have left fruit in my room for weeks and forgotten about it and they've rotted
* don't take notes in any of my classes because i literally cant i just doodle all class
* can't read any articles or books without skipping paragraphs  

   * like this one class we're always reading articles and i've literally never been able to get through one while all the other kids in class know the answers to the reflection questions after the article, and i can't ever even answer one question

what brought on me asking my doctor for an adhd test is that a few days ago, we were watching a video in one of my classes, and i thought i was paying attention the whole time because the video was on a subject i was actually super interested in, but when our teacher asked reflection questions, i couldn't answer any of them because i didn't remember or understand what happened in the video.

but then there's also **things that make me feel like i might not have adhd** (and mostly these are things that my parents have told me, both my parents don't want me to get tested and say i dont have it):

* have gone to test-in magnet schools since elementary school and i'm actually a pretty good student, i end up with mostly A's  

   * in middle school i had allll A's and it was only because middle school was actually weirdly very easy to me
   * high school yes i have B's and even a C right now in math, but really my bad grades are only in subject i'm not that interested in for the most part which idk might just be normal
* my doctor's never told me i seem like i might have adhd (another doctor family friend has told me i seem like i have adhd but not my own doc)
* i feel like maybe my symptoms fall within normalcy, at least that's what my parents have been telling me

i'm worried that if i get tested and don't have adhd, then i'll just feel horrible that i have all these problems and i don't even have a valid reason for having these problems.

please let me know if you guys think i might actually have adhd and what the chances of me having adhd are if you can (also i'm aware reddit isn't like a medical eval. or anything but i want some second opinions). thank you!",2023-01-27 20:06:25,1674849985

nosurf,Social Media Moderation,"Hey guys, so I was pretty addicted to social media, but I managed to moderate it pretty well this past week using a routine. 
I would ban social media from Sunday to Thursday, every single one of them, and I do nothing but study and work. Then on Friday and half of Saturday, I download all my social medias and watch as many videos as I want for entertainment. By the time half of my Saturday is over, I ban social media again till the following Thursday. 
So far, this method has been working really well for me! If you’re addicted to social media I would highly recommend doing this method. It sounds pretty aggressive I’m ngl, cuz you’re pretty much not gonna be active for 5 1/2 out of the 7 days on social media, but this aggressive approach actually got me to get all my shit done. Just a suggestion I wanted to share on here.

nosurf,Stop Hanging Out with the Losers!,"Now, before I get going let me tell you guys that all of you, the people who are waking up, aren't the losers I am talking about.  The losers are the people who still genuinely use Reddit addictively without being aware of it.  They are the scrollers, the people abusing this site as if it were a substance.  The people whose life is falling apart around them.

This site is the equivalent of that one table that the losers sit at in the dining hall at university.  

You know the one I am talking about.  The one that the incels sit at, the dweebs, the assholes who think that women aren't dating them because they are ""nerds.""  Nope, women aren't dating you because you're an awful human being.

I used to sit at that table.  Then one day, I saw a woman I liked at a party and I asked her out.  I started hanging around her friends.  She joined a sorority.  All of the fraternities at my university were hell holes, so I didn't pledge, but I still hung out with her crowd.

You know what happened?  I started to get better.  I started learning how to behave and act like an adult.  I became more attractive to the people who hung out with my girlfriend and I started building bridges.

It is the same thing here.  This website, Reddit, is the loser table.

Everyone who uses this site acts like they have the answers.

Dude, if you have the answers, why are you wasting hours of your day on this stupid website?  If you know how to be the perfect husband, why are you spending hours of your day in this dumpster, instead of spending time with your wife?

If you have all of the answers to how to stay sober, how to live a life of value, WHY THE HELL ARE YOU ON THE INTERNET!

Because they DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS!

Getting the hell off the internet and living your fucking life is the FIRST STEP to getting the answers.

That is what I learned in university, and that is what I am learning all over again now.

So, get your smart, good looking, sexy asses off of the fucking internet, and into your lives people.

Or continue to sit at that loser table, complaining about how your life is going nowhere.

nosurf,tiktok was literally ruining my life,"I feel a little embarrassed even saying this, but I finally realize just how much tiktok was ruining my entire life. I would spend HOURS on it everyday, pretty much anytime I had an idle moment. I've never really had an issue with social media before - I've always been able to identify when a certain platform was becoming a problem and delete it cold turkey with nearly no problem - but tiktok was another story. This was not for lack of trying, either - I tried every single life hack and tip in the book to reduce my screentime and kick the habit. I felt like a junkie, becoming restless and irritable without it, and would ultimately fail in ""quitting."" This time, I hope it sticks because I finally realized how much of a loser it was making me become (for lack of a better word). 

My attention span was practically that of a 5 year old kid, and, even only having deleted it for about a day, I've noticed such better mental clarity now that its gone. Because of this, I was putting off any task that took longer than a few minutes - big and small. I cannot believe I allowed an app to do this to me!

This stuff is like brain heroin, for real. I would have tiktoks running in the background of almost any task I was doing. I would stay up late just scrolling at the endless content (sleep deprivation had its own consequences). What sucks even more is that it wasn't even fun! I was always bored! I was scrolling away even though it wasn't even doing anything for me - but its so entrenched in our culture and in my old lifestyle that I was afraid to stop (major fomo with trends and news). 

I hope more research is done on this app in the near future - this cannot be okay! I know so many people who are/were in the same boat I was, and that's the scariest part of all. Please tell me I'm not alone in how pervasive it was in my life- and if you can relate, I'd love to hear your tips for how you helped kick your tiktok addiction.",2023-01-26 13:54:33,1674741273

It supports 4G LTE which is essential when buying a dumbphone nowadays. It comes preloaded with most applications people need like a browser, phone/messaging, calculator, email client, mp3 player, and more. It is also able to side load Android APK's for those who need a specific application on their phone like Whatsapp (I only needed Google Maps, Ticketmaster, and the Bible app).

nosurf,Why Social Tech is Dehumanizing Us,"My last [post](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3D/r/nosurf/comments/zmfcvu/social_media_has_dehumanized_humanity_and_has/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1674631263853856%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0UvHWOBKzm8fsxNV8ZAGNS&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1674631263874789&amp;usg=AOvVaw0LihDYW3ry0QF2RemvC387) on this subreddit about social media detailed about the unconformable “social machine” that virtual and digital tech, web 2.0/3.0, and social media was all morphing early generations into with “dehumanization” attributes.

Some people point out the hypocrisy of using Reddit, online tech, etc to write about this issue, but consider this, a judo master uses the momentum of the very opponent that they’re trying to slam to the ground. There’s nothing contradictory about using social networks to shed light on dehumanization due to virtual/digital tech. So long as people can avoid valuing instant gratification in itself, But as long as the ultimate goal is kept in mind and tech is used solely as a tool (as it was supposedly designed) for an end, there is no real contradiction. We ultimately don’t want to be addicted, and an efficient means to that end is, ironically, having to use something equally addictive.  

1. Biological Means

By pulling a human out of the real world and embedding them in a simulated environment made of superficial data, the force of frictionless technology may break bonds and dissipate frictions, allowing people in close environments (schools, homes, work, etc) to not just glide past one another, but to form a “second unconformable community body” that spans a whole generation. A system of virtualized constituents. The collective hive-mind absorbs our consciousness, developing and distorting our ideas, opinions, morals, and principles. Constant duplication of what appeared immediately, but the source material has long been destroyed. A chaos of heterogeneous constituents, the body of a system where its agents pull in mutual conjunction and feed off of each other.

Internet addicted people already suffer a form of the atrophy of their cognitive and human function, as these functions are replaced by social tech that automates them. Neuroimaging studies of internet-immersed youth point to widespread abnormalities and reduced densities in white and gray brain matter, including in the cerebellum. The impairments cover core human cognitive functions, attention, memory, emotion, cognition, etc. All of which have decreased in importance to the extent that they are no longer used. Authors of these papers note the similarity of their present findings to neuroimaging patterns associated with drug addiction.

If these cognitive elements are being lost to tech, and if they *are* the elements of intelligence, this means an outbound transfer of intelligence from humans to machines together with the relinquishment of native faculties and the consequent outflow of humans-as-data. It’s not just that machines are becoming more powerful at no absolute cost to humans, with human capabilities remaining flat, but that algorithms are increasingly capable at a great cost to human intelligence. The atrophy of personal/emotive faculties through tech results in a loss for humans because they impair the native ability of humans to their powers together in the real world directly, without a middleman, for the achievement of strictly human ends. While social and digital tech simulates human interaction itself, they superficially sustain that function.

1. Social Tech

Social/Virtual/Digital tech introduces separation by replacing direct interaction with an interconnected assortment of simulacra, in which human interaction is dislocated not only in space but also in time. Instead of addressing one another directly, humans direct their entreaties at a maze of technological filters that populate simulated, temporally fragmented, imaginary. Every human is simultaneously connected to a common system that simulates human relations. Participating by the algorithm through a hyper interface (e.g., # of “follower”/ “friend” accounts, number of times a human reacted to the emotive stimulus a text fragment or video by activating a stimulus parameter that the algorithm has set, online comments providing looped references hundreds of times over and over, that people self-reference in the ‘body-form’ within the real world)

Virtual tech achieves permanence and deepens its roots by programming humans to act and react only adjacently to itself and to interact directly only with the algorithm that stands between them. People simultaneously enact themselves as data while seated or standing adjacent to one another in a multitude of settings, all nurturing and tending to the same algorithms to the mutual neglect of one another. Buffering technologies systematize, absorb, and nullify human interaction. Whether it be formal or informal, and incorporate it into technique in a way that Ellul described with regard to everything else that is natural.

The human stops being a social being in such real-time environments: being inside the social system is socially inert. Systematization makes human interaction seem less emotionally difficult and burdensome, that is, less discomforting, demanding, or unpredictable. Tech takes on the form of a low-resolution human sociality, Social tech/media, other humans are rendered abstract, distant, asynchronous, and dislocated from time, space, and in many ways, reality; they are removed from the energetic and emotional exchanges and experiences that are a natural part of unscripted real world human encounter previously seen through natural human engagement.

Interfacing with digital tech, which emerges as a function to effectively serve as a representative in their scripted data performances directed at other human data. The social data profile a human’s “algorithmic” and “quantitative,” self. In writing its profile, the contents of their mind are written, in this case, the substance of social self, to the machine in the form of data. The human is writing the skeleton of their own data dossier to the machine.

The data transmission itself serves as the algorithm’s lifeblood. A human’s revelation of an emotive fragment to the algorithm, which presents itself to another human in the form of an emotive stimulus, in whatever medium and platform, and the next human’s reaction to that stimulus, combine to form a simulation of interaction; large volumes of these fragments strung together simulate a relation. As a result of this process, human interactions attempted through the buffer of the simulated environment come out in contextually distorted pieces and fragments, in a form native to machines, but the attempts of all of them together combine to form a single, integrated, cumulative data store.

The result stands in conformity to the way that virtual/digital/online tech, not humans, natively operate, that is evidence of the tech’s priority over the human. Human relationships as data are raw material, all homogeneous. The subtleties of human relationships that are of quality, are lost in the data stream, and are expendable. The machine equivalent, the vast collection of human profiles and the data revelations surrounding them, Collectively come together to take the form of “social content.”

1. Dehumanization

Social content consists of data fragments. Social tech, claims original title to the name of that which is simulated, its presence hastening the disappearance of the original. Turning human relations into units of relational data used for the care and feeding of algorithms. The social self, which is as compulsively tended to in every detail as the human self once was, comes to take precedence over it. The body form, on the other hand, is met with doubt and neglected, as it is deprived of that same intensive, nurturing energy now being devoted to the replicated self. Algorithms relieve humans of what they may consider to be the burden of genuine interhuman engagement under conditions where mutual expectations and experiences of reciprocity and trust had already largely disappeared.

Only the simulacrum remains. Expectations that humans come to have of both themselves are downgraded accordingly to accommodate these new machine values and priorities. Humans injected with “machine-like virtues” and priorities find it more difficult, and simultaneously less important, to do things together as humans in unfiltered, unsystematized real world spaces. Most of Gen Z and young adults are in the mere presence of the simulacrum, also conjoined with the real world. As the machine’s priorities continue to eclipse the human, humans gradually become nodes in a device-centric system. Human emotional and intellectual quality are lost, and relational data units are freely distributed as data units containing the stimulus responses of people.

To tend to the machine’s insane demands for data. Human minds reordered into a pattern collectively form the human data reserve, The native social faculties of people, which are of no use to the machine/algo in their original state, but which are very useful to it as data, begin to atrophy from non-use as they fade into obsolescence. Human minds are disrobed by social tech, their emotional entrails turned inside out and back again in full view of all others into a 4th dimension devoid of self-reflection. Un-subjugated connections require the ability for individuals to retreat from untenable/unworkable ideas, or from random expressions of dissent not made with the threat of premature attribution of such expressions and references to and for them.

By carving up human relations into a disjointed system of displaced fragments, it fractures and actively depletes human connection. If it's human connection itself that’s identified to be the friction, in fracturing and depleting the human connection, the human ends up fracturing and depleting themself, their original imperfect self decaying behind the profile.

Just as the spatial orientation algorithm depletes the human spatial orientation faculty as it renders it obsolete, algorithms do the same with the human social faculty. As ‘automatic’ displaces the human’s individual and cognitive functions, virtual separation does the same to their relational/emotive functions. Functions change from being human functions to machine functions. Human functions are displaced and replaced with machine forms that substitute social tech for reciprocity and addiction, and thus move toward dehumanization.

A systematic, automatic feedback hub, layered, cumulative, and dynamic, that with every layer added, possibilities previously unseen are opened up for more revealing and ordering of deeper resources for use. Humans' relationship with virtual tech began to show its true nature, one in which virtual tech advances not as part of humanity’s development, but in a regressive way, directly at our expense.",2023-01-25 22:43:35,1674686615
nosurf,So done with the Mastodon/Twitter model,"Basically the same thing regardless of which site.

I'm done with the 'post onto this timeline which asks nothing more than 'what's up' or 'what's happening' etc then expect people to read it' model.

Inevitably end up oversharing. Inevitably end up surprised when people don't notice what I've overshared (I think this is cos I have diagnosed social anxiety although maybe it is an ego thing) and talking to me in an overly familiar way which contradicts what my TL says about me.

It's a really weird mix of people being strangers &amp; people not being strangers.

I don't feel like it on other sites. On other sites I just get the 'stranger' feeling. Which is fine, it keeps things polite &amp; should be the distance we have between ourselves &amp; online strangers. On Reddit, there's a single post so it's only annoying if the context of that post contradicts what the response is. In real life? I know people the level I know them. It doesn't feel as blurry.

I'm off Twitter anyway but I've decided to try &amp; use Mastodon for nothing more than sharing art &amp; sharing opinions on football matches as they happen (and if I can't see them 'live' with other irl people). See how that goes for a bit.

Mastodon loves to pretend it's better than Twitter. In a lot of ways, especially right now, it is. But it's the same model when it comes to TLs and being able to share (and overshare) anything.",2023-01-25 21:54:37,1674683677
nosurf,Tiktok is the fast food of entertainment,"When I went  travelling last year I downloaded Tiktok as a way to document the trip, and guess what...I got addicted as fuck. Almost immediately it became my most used app (quick side note: almost all modern phones can track your usage time on your phone and certain apps in general. If you don’t know how to do this try searching for “screen time” “app usage” or “digital hygiene” on your phone’s settings).  


If you’ve seen my content before on here or on my YouTube channel, then you know that I largely abstain from social media. I used to be a very heavy social media user and it always felt like my usage was robbing me of something else. (Read more about it here). So why did I decide to try tiktok? One real reason: exposure. I wanted a way to document my travels, and I wanted to use what has been described as the easiest platform to get views. There’s not much more to it than that. I went clout chasing. Roughly one week after downloading it, I’ve had to delete it from my phone. Here’s why:  


Tiktok is the fast food of entertainment. It has been designed to be as rewarding as possible with almost no time expense (per tiktok). If you’re after a quick dopamine rush it is definitely the easiest way to get it.  


We all know fast food is bad for us. We know that companies like McDonald’s try and make the tastiest burgers they can. And we know that to achieve this they have to sacrifice your health, they have to fill them with the most rewarding (high sugar, high fat) ingredients they can, and to make this experience even more rewarding for you, they prioritise speed and eliminate wait times. Almost everyone is in agreement that fast foods are bad for you. It’s not that we don’t enjoy the taste, but fundamentally they have a negative impact on our health.  


Tiktok is largely the same, the content you consume is designed to be the most rewarding it can be. An algorithm monitors your ‘watch time’ on each tiktok you see and uses that data to recommend you content that other users who has similar watch times to you enjoy. For example, say you watch a full minute of a video of two people having a fight on a bus. The tiktok algorithm will show you other videos that people who also watched the one minute bus fight video watched for long periods of time. It learns what’s rewarding to you by comparing your watch times to people with similar interests. If you quickly scroll past a makeup tutorial, it’ll begin to learn that that style of content isn’t rewarding to you and you’ll begin to see less and less of the content that people who watch make-up tutorials see. What you’re left with is a ‘For you page’ that is tailored to be as engaging and rewarding as the algorithm deems possible.  


What’s the harm in having an endless stream of the most rewarding content? The short answer is: You get used to it. Your brain adapts to receiving reward and engagement every 30 or so seconds. It gets so used to this constant stream of reward that it begins to expect it. Why is expecting to be rewarded every 30 seconds harmful? Because it decreases the appeal of longevity and discipline. Your brain will begin to struggle concentrating on tasks that require patience and commitment and instead crave short term dopamine spikes. Sitting down to read a book for 20 minutes will begin to seem like a challenge as your brain is not used to delayed gratification.  


Imagine you go to turn a tap on, and instead of the water coming out instantly, nothing happens for 10 seconds. 10 seconds isn’t a lot of time, but because your brain is so used to the water flowing as soon as you turn the tap, 10 seconds will feel like a lifetime. Chances are, you’ll begin to get annoyed with any tap that takes 10 seconds. Now imagine the same principle applied to feeling good. **Your brain becomes so adapted to getting rewarded multiple times a minute, that everything else seems boring and time consuming.**  
To a more extreme example it’s a similar psychological framework of drug addiction  
The brain receives intense dopamine spikes from the drugs that afterwards, the user begins to crave, unable to find similar dopamine spikes in daily life, the user returns to using the substance. (It’s important to note that addiction is more complicated than just this, there are environmental factors and of course most drugs are also chemically addictive rather than solely psychological).  


So Is TikTok harmful? No, just like a large big Mac meal isn’t harmful. **The harm comes if you overconsume.** Your brain will begin to expect these rewards if it receives them frequently and in large quantities. Before I quit social media, my attention span and commitment to goals was rubbish. I developed new hobbies and passions every couple of weeks, I could never workout (even if I set myself low goals like 7 minutes a day), I would lose interest in books after the first couple of pages and I was on the path to becoming someone I didn’t want to be. **Quitting social media had a galvanizing effect on me**, it helped me find focus and more importantly it helped me find my centre. A centre that I could operate in and develop. I’ve never really looked back.  
If you are like I used to be and you quit things when they get hard, or maybe you struggle to read or workout for short periods of time, then maybe you should reconsider your social media input. If on the other hand you are a deeply focused person who struggles to let things go and sees tasks out to the bitter end, then maybe TikTok might do you some good.",2023-01-25 21:25:26,1674681926
nosurf,Looking for a good app blocker try AppBlock.,"Before I start this is not sponsored.

I lack the will power a lot of times to stop surfing so I've tried different app blocks to stop it. I always find a way to get around them most commonly by opening the app via pop up view on the app.

Then I came along AppBlock https://www.appblock.app/ This is by far the best app to use as the setting you can do are really particular and even stops the pop up view. Some examples are

•Time Limit duration or certain times of the dag.
•Different groups of blocked apps
•Lock down the block setting for example can't change the 10 minute limit in Facebook for 1 day or even 30 days.
•Unable to uninstall the app itself!!! This is a huge thing for me because I used to get around appblocks by uninstalling them when I was bored. 
 
It has all the other features you aspect and more.

I just wanted to post this as it really has helped me during work and spending time with family and hope it helps you guys too. 

I do pay the $5 a month premium but for me that's worth it the amount of time I'm off my phone.

I could be doing something really meaningful. I could be truly living my life.

nosurf,I relapsed on nosurf - My one week experience,"I bought a kSafe box to put my phone and laptop charger, meaning I was without the internet for a whole week. I had a dumbphone (a Nokia) but that was about it. 

The one week was great, I was reading a lot of books that I've had for two years and still haven't finished, I was using the internet in the library which means my time was limited and I was not going to browser reddit there either. I felt A LOT more productive. I work nights and during the day when I wake up my only habit is to chill on my laptop/phone. When I locked these away, I was forced to get up, go to the library, study, and do things that I needed to do (shopping, cleaning etc).

I did miss the music and the ease of the smartphone but the benefits outweighed the cons. I'm going to jump back on my dumbphone soon, I'm just going to buy an iPod classic for my music/podcasts before I do.

nosurf,Looking for an accountability partner to talk sense into me during emergencies of mindless scrolling,"Hi. So I have been on a self care journey and it’s been going really well. I have changed my diet, going regularly to the gym, being social everyday.

BUT, it’s time for my exams and I have noticed whenver I get too stressed, all my life goes into chaos- not because of the thing which is about to happen but because of how I react to it.

For example, I am too stressed that instead of revising my notes I am binging YouTube songs ( I enjoy it a lot but after 3 hours of just watching songs, I want to stop but I can’t). And then I don’t even like watching Netflix and Apple TV or whatever but when I am stressed I just go back to these things cos then I won’t have to think and just be mindless. And I was thinking who could I possibly message at this time to talk sense into me and tell me it’s okay and that I need to take a deep breath and let go.

nosurf,"A ""rush"" like feeling when on SNS?","In very recent times, I've become aware of two things: What I am experiencing and have been for years is an addiction, and what exactly that addiction entails. I'm not yet ready to make a long post detailing my longtime experience of it, so instead I'll focus on an observation. 

In particular, one thing I've noticed is what happens when I really log on and start checking places like Twitter or TikTok. There's this feeling that instantly grows in my body, similar to something like an adrenaline rush. I've legitimately never noticed, or perhaps I did and never thought about, this light-switch in feeling. I assume it has something to do with Dopamine. It's hard to describe, it's like bubbles of electricity and elation floating around in my stomach/chest. I know the way I'm putting it makes me sound alien, but the thing is this isn't like normal euphoria or excitement to me. Similar, but it feels so much more artificial and specific. It's just not the same feeling as receiving a gift or accomplishing something.

 Maybe I'm just thinking too hard about it. But either way, the part that stands out to me though, is that it's not just triggered by new notifications or uploads for example. It's just being on there in itself and scrolling around. It's concerning the more you notice it.",2023-01-24 21:53:13,1674597193

nosurf,My failed attempts and the lessons I learned,"Hello everyone,

I (31m) want to tell you how I tried nosurf (cold turkey) for two times, how I slipped up and the lessons I have learned. Sorry for any mistakes (my mother tongue isn‘t English).

**- Start -**

My addiction to the internet started with reading the news online, reading articles on Wikipedia and chatting / using dating platforms. I also used to play computer games online (Star Wars Battlefront II). Nowadays I still spend a lot of my time reading the news online and communicate on dating platforms.

**- Nosurf attempt #1 -**

When I did my first attempt at nosurf, it worked quite well for about a month. I went cold turkey (no news, dating platforms, mindless browsing...). Things I did in my free time included meditation (at least one hour a day), walking, reading, writing a diary or writing monologues. I also spend many hours just sitting and thinking in a relaxed manner, while doing nothing else. While the first days were challenging, at some point I felt completely free of my addiction, until it kicked in again. I cannot remember why it came back. I just knew the feeling when I relapsed and how I indulged in it.

**- Nosurf attempt #2 -**

Pretty much the same as #1. Except that it lasted for three weeks and I didn't have the feeling I was able to overcome my addiction.

**- My lessons -**

Looking back, my situation during these two attempts were quite different: During attempt #1, I had no other obligations except my work. While doing attempt #2, I attended a programming course, was looking for a job and just moved into a new flat and needed to organize many things.

**&gt;&gt;&gt; Lesson #1 &lt;&lt;&lt;**

Start your nosurf journey when you don‘t have any other projects going on in your life.

And I also realized that cold turkey and zero internet didn‘t work for me. When I try nosurf next time, I will try a gradual approach. Eg. doing a given activity like meditation for one hour while completely disconnect from everything.

**&gt;&gt;&gt; Lesson #2 &lt;&lt;&lt;**

If cold turkey attempts failed in the past, how about trying a gradual approach?

Another thing that was different during my first attempt was my state of mind. During my first attempt, I was deep into (meditation) practice and had a higher level of general awareness. Giving things up happened naturally, including going offline for extended periods of time (even before doing nosurf). During my second attempt I hardly had any practice and my state of mind was average at best.

**&gt;&gt;&gt; Lesson #3 &lt;&lt;&lt;**

How are you feeling overall? Do you have a balanced mind? If not, maybe it is more effective to do something about your mental health first, before trying no surf.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**

Try nosurf when you have the energy and time in your free time, do a gradual approach and do it when you have a balanced state of mind.",2023-01-24 14:28:54,1674570534

nosurf,"IMO, the reason you are addicted to your phone is due to one of two things; either your life is extremely boring OR you are seeking validation, which could be due to some sort of mental illness (in some cases you could be suffering from both scenarios) *LONG POST*","Something has hit me recently. We seem to get two types of people who use the internet (in this case, we'll talk about social media specifically) 

(Two types of people who are addicted to social media) 

We have the ones who's lives are so boring that they find it more entertaining watching other people live their lifes (through either looking at pictures on instagram, or watching videos on youtube or tiktok etc) 

These people could also be quite lonely too. I think there is a relation between being lonely and having a *boring* life. They kinda come hand in hand... 

These people are at risk of developing something called a *parasocial relationship* with online content creators/influencers or celebrities. 

In simple terms, they are so lonely and their life is so boring that they binge on other peoples content so much that they start developing an emotional *attachment* towards either the content itself or the creators behind the content. 

This can be scary, because we can slowly start to lose sight of our own life in the real world. We start to neglect our own hobbies and interests and instead of living our life in the *real* world, we become too engaged in the online world and once we get stuck down the rabbit hole, it's extremely hard to get out because we now truely believe we have developed a real connection with the people *online* (but it's NOT real) it's a parasocial relationship which isnt healthy. You are wasting your time and energy investing in these strangers who don't even know *you* exist. 

The 2nd type of people who are addicted to social media are those who constantly seek validation from others. These people could even be the *influencers* and *celebrities* themselves... (so never be fooled when you see someone online who seems to *have it all* .... They are probably posting stuff online because they are desperately seeking attention) 

I truely believe this is some sort of undiagnosed mental disorder. For someone to seek validation and seek *likes* from other people surely indicates alot of *mental* weakness and insecurities. There could be an underlying problem they arn't even aware of. Maybe they didn't get enough love growing up? Who knows. But the amount of attention some people crave is not normal or healthy. Something else is definately going on. 

If someone was truely happy and content with their lives, I don't believe they would have to post everything on social media. I mean, why would they? (Perhaps excluding posting a family picture for close friends and family who they don't visit often etc) why would someone who is truely happy feel the need to expose their whole life on social media for the world to see? (Unless they are seeking validation) 

I think these things don't get addressed enough. It seems the majority of people are suffering from one of these two things (some could be suffering from both which is beyond insanity at this point) 

You would hope that your problem is the former. (A boring life) 

Because then, it's easier to get to work on bettering yourself and slowly start building towards a more fullfiling life for yourself. 

If your problem is the latter. (Insanity) Then im not really sure what the answer is because each case could be different. People need to be truely honest with themselves. 

You would need to get to the root problem first and build on it from there. Perhaps even talking to a specialist/therapist etc.. 

I think this is why just trying to go *cold turkey* doesnt work for some people (the ones who are desperately seeking validation) because something deeper is going on inside. And unless they figure that sh*t out, they will continue to suffer, perhaps even worse if they quit the internet cold turkey believing thats the answer, because without their validation/fix (like a drug) they could sink into even further depression which consequently i believe could have lead to many suicides etc.. (some people need *proper* legit help) 

I just think it doesn't get spoken about enough in my opinion. The world is getting very dark. There is so much pressure these days to do well or make someone from ourselves, not to even mention the cost of living going up etc... it's extremely hard times. 

And technology is not helping for people who are the victims of one of these two scenarios. 

Anyway, thanks for reading if you have. All the best.",2023-01-24 10:56:32,1674557792

nosurf,"Most stuff on Reddit is written by chronically online mentally unhealthy people. Don't waste your time talking to people here, save your sanity.","I realised this when I stumbled upon a subreddit with really weird views, a couple of years ago. At the time it had around 50K subscribers, and I thought, there's no way 50K people actually think like this. But after browsing through it for an hour or so, I noticed literally every post had a comment by a single specific user, who was also a moderator. They commented on every post, replied to every comment, etc.

A few days ago I saw a comment mentioning that subreddit. I wondered what that subreddit was up to now. I went there and... still the same moderator, years later, commenting on post after post, debating with people. I looked at their account and counted 60 comments in the last 24 hours. And they were constant and spread out over 12 or so hours, meaning this person is actually using Reddit 12 HOURS a day.

For me, 60 comments means going back around 3 months. And I consider myself a pretty active Reddit user.

That means this one person comments 100x as much as I do. And they are far from the worst case, and not the only one either.

Add to this that only around 2% of Reddit users even comment on posts at all (numbers vary but most sources say 1-3%), and you come to the conclusion that **if even 1 in 5000 (0.02%) of people is such a ""Hardcore Redditor"", they will write half of all Reddit comments.**

If 1 in 1000 Redditrs are ""hardcore Redditors"", the number shoots up to over 85%.

Now the question is, are these ""hardcore Redditors"" normal people? Are these people whose opinions you care about? People who you want to argue with? Are these sane, mentally healthy people? Do you think these people regularly exercise, hang out with their friends, and have interesting hobbies? Are these the kind of people you would want in your life?

&gt;*You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.*

nosurf,I left my 16k followers on TikTok.,"I was a niche Star Wars/franchise “micro-influencer” on TikTok and I recently scrapped my account after a lot of deliberation.

I found myself on a backup account a few days later, but it simply wasn’t as magnetic as there was no constant influx of notifications from engagement. 

Noticed that the algorithm was getting to know me a little too well, so I just deleted that account, too. I also deleted my Twitter (which was probably my other 50% of screen time) and Instagram accounts while riding the high of the digital liberation. 

Been spending more time on Reddit, but it’s been manageable, and largely a very positive experience. I feel like I’m actually connecting with people of similar principles and interests, and not stuck in this insufferable hype-to-discourse-to-burnout pipeline common to franchise media.

In my newfound free time, I’ve learned how to do some DIY work around my house, begun organizing a local effort to put in a neighborhood park, and learned about composting and Missouri soil types so I can gardening this spring. I’ve felt more present with my family—something I’ve had a really long struggle with. I’ve also started reading SO much more. I’m deep into hard sci-fi, recent sociology/anthropology, and anarchism.

I was already a pretty good reader, but it was mostly Star Wars material. I realized that I was expending SO much energy keeping up with Lucasfilm Publishing just to talk about it on TikTok/Twitter and make content. I really like some of the SW books, and have a deep love for that world—but I hadn’t realized that a less overt consumerism had become so deeply rooted in me over time despite me being generally anti-consumption. I feel somewhat ashamed of my massive bookshelf solely made up of Star Wars books—1/3rd of which I didn’t like, or haven’t started. 

It feels so good to actually give my attention to things that I care about.

Posting this feels a little self-indulgent, but I sometimes get upturned noses when I tell people that I’ve gone mostly offline which is truly bizarre and unpleasant.

nosurf,Starting my journey,"I am starting my NoSurf journey. Due to personal circumstances quitting the Internet is no longer a matter of choice, but a necessity. I am very anxious because for the first time in years I will have to face myself, the world and reality and I will have nothing to fall back on. I do not expect this to fix anything in my life, but to give me the possibility to finally solve some of my problems. I usually like keeping things to myself and I was not sure whether to post or not, but I wanted to make a statement to myself - some sort of closure or landmark.",2023-01-23 21:22:38,1674508958
nosurf,Genuine question (long post),"So, currently I'm thinking of quitting the internet altogether, and only use my phone for study/career or other important reasons (Which makes sense since it's the only way I can talk to my family and friends) 

But I have a question. What will I do then? I spend more than 10 hours on my phone, in a constant state of dopamine hunting. I constantly check YouTube Shorts, watch random YouTube videos, put on random songs on Spotify or the same songs all the time, all day, and Reddit and Instagram too, haven't even mentioned Pornography. 

What will I do without my smartphone? Life outside seems extremely boring, I mean isn't that the reason why we hold onto these devices anyway? To ignore how boring life really is? Can I genuinely enjoy life without the internet? I'm thinking of going off of everything for an entire month, to see how that will affect my mental health and general well being. Will I be happier? More content? Less stressed? Better able to sleep? Will I become more productive so? I feel like the internet is stripping me off of my individuality and potential as a human being. I feel as if I would achieve far greater things if it wasn't for internet addiction. And it's so messed up because everyone else seems to be the same way. It's kind of insane to think about. 

What if I put those 10+ hours into anything else? Will boredom get the best of me? I mean, is boredom even a bad thing? Isn't it what eventually motivates us to do something? If we're never bored then we become lethargic and eventually we start thinking that life is meaningless. I'm thinking of February as the challenge. I wanna go offline. The overly bright screens have already messed up one of my eyes and now I see blurry with one eye. But somehow that's not enough to stop me? What the hell? Excuse my language but this is kind of insane to really think about. 

Detox is necessary Asap, these depressing thoughts didn't just come out of nowhere. I am tired of being a slave to this constant cycle, and those bastards laughing at my expense because they have lured me into this addiction. I can feel my life slipping away. The days go, nothing is achieved, life seems dull and meaningless. It does take away that boredom only for the moment to go on my phone, but even then there are moments where I'm just like ""F*cking hell, I'm so bored"" then I watch porn for greater stimulus. I mean there's no way this is okay for our mental health. And to an extent physical too. If I'm panic-stricken without my phone, and extremely uncomfortable when I'm offline what does that mean? The simple things in life are now meaningless and dull. I need extra extra stimulus. I swear If I saw a flamingo I'd be like ""Meh"" then go on my phone to do some dumb sh*t. Anyway. 

It is crazy though. I feel enslaved and I want to be free. I wonder how long it takes for the feelings of ""I need my phone"" to go away.",2023-01-23 21:04:02,1674507842

nosurf,DAE have anxiety regarding their digital footprint,"Hi friends.

I'm making this post to ask - and potentially find some comfort in connecting with others about this topic - does anyone else have paranoia/anxiety regarding their digital footprint? 

This has been a problem for quite some time, and seems to reappear every few months. I can not for the life of me, stop worrying about my information that is online. I have deleted  - and re-created in the process of trying to get over this fear, but soon after deleted again - so many social media accounts I can't even put a number to it. I have tried to find every newsletter and website associated with my email and delete all the accounts if I can, or just remove the subscriptions. I have used tutanota to make more a more private email account, also using those hidemyemail accounts in the process. 

I just spiralled because I looked up my name (3 different names that I go by), and found a photo I can't remove as the first result, and an embarrassing presentation from 13 years ago (luckily I gained access and could delete the account!!).

DAE face this dread? It KILLS me. I don't want any presence online (noted with my name), and often times, I still feel worried about accounts without any personal information and delete them constantly. 

How can I deal with this and overcome this anxiety? I would appreciate any comments.",2023-01-22 22:58:54,1674428334
nosurf,TikTok Shouldn’t Exist.,"In a world where we’re constantly being bombarded by information via our TV, other social media apps, family, friends, radio, etc., TikTok has got to be the worst for info dumping.

The effects that TikTok has had on my attention span is genuinely debilitating, but I don’t think people talk enough about how isolating that app can make you feel. The algorithm purposely creates a feed, catered to your every want/desire, and replays it to you in an endless loop. This algorithm *is* addictive and can feel good to watch in the moment, but I think in a darker, more deeper sense it’s rewiring the way our brains feel empathy and compassion since these algorithms keep everyone in their own little bubble. Politics have become less about actually joining together and fighting for a good cause, and more about screaming your point the loudest so that you can feel important. In a world with so much suffering, individualism to this extremity is the **last** thing we need right now.

I’ve deleted the app numerous times in the past, but I’m doing it again in an effort to (truly) quit this time. How long will it last? I have no idea, it feels like an irresistible addiction. The fact that I have ADHD doesn’t help either. All I know is that I hope this is the last time I quit.

I would love to hear what you guys think about TikTok, as I feel like there’s a greater discussion to be had about how insidious the app really is.",2023-01-22 21:16:07,1674422167

nosurf,1 year on!,"Most people don't come back, so I'm doing a little writeup of what having no personal social media is like.

My original goal in 2022 was to delete, or stop using but keep up, all social media. I started 2022 addicted to Twitter, Discord, Instagram, etc. I was spending at least an hour per day on these sites, though in the case of Discord or Twitter is was more like 4-5. If those seem like rookie numbers, that's because I'd cut down over the last 2 years from 15 years of (at one point) 12-hour days. Not only was I depressed and miserable with zero perspective and horrendous social anxiety, I was irritable as fuck and couldn't concentrate at all, even to get through a sentence sometimes.

Nowadays...well, read on. Let's just say there's a lot I didn't consider when I started.

# The first 6 months

There's a 30 day wait once you deactivate many of these sites to permanently delete. I relapsed and logged back in once to Twitter, so when I re-deactivated it, I changed my email to a dead email I can't use, and password to some keysmash I'd never remember and uninstalled the app. For the first week it was genuinely very difficult to stay away, but I couldn't get my account back, so I was forced to run the 30 day wait period.

I left all my groups in Discord and logged out of that too, but it was less addictive than Twit for me and by the second week I'd forgotten about it.

I didn't deactivate Instagram. Why? Because some discussions here suggested that no social media can make your dating/social life hard. I'll get back to that, but I did make it [too boring to use](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/x5mzuw/make_social_media_boring_again/) before I logged out.

The first few weeks were very difficult. I was extremely bored. I took some very long walks and journalled a LOT. I realised how dissatisfied I was with my life in a number of ways, but this time, instead of ignoring it, I started figuring out solutions and actioning them because I had nothing else to think about. Social media had really made me ignore ALL my problems, and for the first 12 -18 weeks I was very unhappy and dissatisfied with the state of my life. Nevertheless I decided to commit to nosurf and see if the bad feelings would ever end.

I also learnt a *lot* about myself, because I was spending so much time with myself. It was honestly difficult at times to journal and see what were *my* opinions/values and what opinions/values I'd adopted from the online culture as my own. Some pretty brutal talks with myself there about career direction, personal direction, etc. In fact, later on, I realised I'd been headed down a career path I hated for quite a while now, and I perhaps could have made different decisions with my studies too, but I was deep in my addiction when I made those decisions. Fortunately, who I was at 16 or 18 does not have to dictate the rest of my life.

Though I started feeling better almost immediately, the reversal of the bad effects actually took a few months. By month 5 I was able to finish a long read article or a lecture-length video and actually listen to/be able to recall what was said. That would probably have happened at month 3 for most people, but I had surgery which delayed a few things. I started to notice that it was a lot easier to be positive around months 5 and 6 as well. My stress levels reduced over time to absolutely manageable, and my OCD/irritability also reduced a *lot*. I started feeling more in control and proactive around month 6 as well, whereas before I had felt so helpless and like nothing was worthwhile. I was finding it a lot easier to stay present and appreciate the summer, and spent a lot of time outside.

I also found many new hobbies and interests. Not all of them stuck (I don't enjoy reading books as much as I used to, for instance) but some have, and I've been having a *lot* of genuinely satisfying, good clean fun!

# The next 6 months

It took about month 8 before I started feeling up to socialising irl again. At first I just hung out/repaired relationships with my family and best friends, but slowly I started reaching out beyond my social circle. Gradually I started feeling a bit braver to talk to random people in the shop or around (if it seeme appropriate). It didn't always work out, but since I had no social media to scroll away my discomfort with I was forced to learn from the experience. And there was always a next time. Around month 10-11 I even felt ready to date, when the opportunity presented itself!

Actually, my social skills came back surprisingly fast once I got a bit of practice. I still get anxious, but to think that even 4 months ago talking to the store clerk would make me want to be sick, I'm genuinely surprised. I can write more about this if it helps, but the transition from almost exclusively online to irl-only socialisation is such a massive and significant change. My social life did not, in fact, suffer like I thought it would - in fact I felt better and got outside more, which made me meet more people who wanted to be friends.

I also revisited Instagram and Discord after 6 or so months away, [and found that I don't enjoy it much at all](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/y35kjk/you_lose_your_taste_for_it_eventually/). Stopping using it again was quite easy.

I'll be honest, there's been some slippage recently, which is why I'm readjusting my goals for 2023. I work full time, so with a steady routine it's been pretty easy to replace times I would be on social media with something else (books, hobbies, whatever). I've really struggled with the lack of structure from Christmas/New Year, and it's given rise to the old bad habits. I can already feel myself getting more annoyed and concentrating less, like the old days - which tells me it's time for another digital cleanse.

# What I learned from 1 year away

* Getting rid of social media is a **net positive**. The break genuinely did improve my mood, my concentration, and (surprisingly), my social life, although there was a long dip period and it was a lot of effort to restart.
* A lot of people **get discouraged by the long dip period before you learn how to live without incessant scrolling/social media use.** And it fuckin sucks. If I could go back I'd definitely have more puzzles, games, and social events lined up (and being laid up in bed post surgery didn't help either). But I think either way, it just sucks for a bit. And then it stops. But it will suck.
* **There is real value in online communities that centre around an interest,** but not in personal social media. I really enjoy blogging, and I'll probably start an interest blog at some point. There's no need, however, to talk about my personal life on the internet, or get into fights with random strangers. Like none at all. It's never relevant or a good use of time.
* **I am not a monk,** and you probably aren't either. Simple living and meditating in the garden was my ultimate fantasy for this year, but it absolutely wasn't for me at all when I tried it. Turns out I have an active mind that needs stimulation and I find it satisfying to set and achieve goals and play with puzzles. Better, though, for those goals to be something that affects my *real* life, **where I can** ***actually*** **benefit from it.**
* **The guilt of all those wasted hours is real. I'm still working through it*****.*** I could have been in a very different place in multiple ways had I not lived my entire life online for all of my teenage years and the first half of my twenties. Now I'm going to have to upskill to career change, learn social confidence most people achieved 10 years ago, etc. Embarrassing! But at least I'm doing it. **Social media kept me distracted from everything that really needed doing*****,*** and even **helped me ignore myself**, with damaging consequences.

But there's nothing I can do about the past. It's time to turn this around as best I can. Tbh having a friend who happened to be doing the same thing around the same time I was, was so helpful, and if I were to do it again I'd tell my loved ones about what was going on so they could support me.

I really hope this post can help people realise it's absolutely possible and good to nosurf, and I really thank this community for being here and helping me. The very first step for me was being honest about what social media is, and [this post about Reddit being a bar filled with losers](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/sxwi5y/choosing_to_spend_today_scrolling_reddit_is_like/) really helped. I have been realising as well that Dead Internet Theory isn't a theory at all. It's a [prophecy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL8rHf_idt0).",2023-01-22 20:09:07,1674418147
nosurf,"""I like the person I become when I read a lot of books. I dislike the person I become when I spend a lot of time on social media."" - Johann Hari","A section from Johann Hari's book ""Stolen Focus"" that I found insightful.

&amp;nbsp;

""As I wandered the streets of Provincetown contemplating some of these questions, I found myself thinking back over a famous idea that I now realized I had never really understood before—one that was also mulled, in a different way, by Nicholas Carr in his book. In the 1960s, the Canadian professor Marshall McLuhan talked a lot about how the arrival of television was transforming the way we see the world. He said these changes were so deep and so profound that it was hard to really see them. When he tried to distill this down into a phrase, he explained that “the medium is the message.” What he meant, I think, was that when a new technology comes along, you think of it as like a pipe—somebody pours in information at one end, and you receive it unfiltered at the other. But it’s not like that. Every time a new medium comes along—whether it’s the invention of the printed book, or TV, or Twitter—and you start to use it, it’s like you are putting on a new kind of goggles, with their own special colors and lenses. Each set of goggles you put on makes you see things differently.

&amp;nbsp;

So (for example) when you start to watch television, before you absorb the message of any particular TV show—whether it’s Wheel of Fortune or The Wire—you start to see the world as being shaped like television itself. That’s why McLuhan said that every time a new medium comes along—a new way for humans to communicate—it has buried in it a message. It is gently guiding us to see the world according to a new set of codes. The way information gets to you, McLuhan argued, is more important than the information itself. TV teaches you that the world is fast; that it’s about surfaces and appearances; that everything in the world is happening all at once.

&amp;nbsp;

This made me wonder what the message is that we absorb from social media, and how it compares to the message that we absorb from printed books. I thought first of Twitter. When you log in to that site—it doesn’t matter whether you are Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders or Bubba the Love Sponge—you are absorbing a message through that medium and sending it out to your followers. What is that message? First: you shouldn’t focus on any one thing for long. The world can and should be understood in short, simple statements of 280 characters. Second: the world should be interpreted and confidently understood very quickly. Third: what matters most is whether people immediately agree with and applaud your short, simple, speedy statements. A successful statement is one that lots of people immediately applaud; an unsuccessful statement is one that people immediately ignore or condemn. When you tweet, before you say anything else, you are saying that at some level you agree with these three premises. You are putting on those goggles and seeing the world through them.

&amp;nbsp;

How about Facebook? What’s the message in that medium? It seems to be first: your life exists to be displayed to other people, and you should be aiming every day to show your friends edited highlights of your life. Second: what matters is whether people immediately like these edited and carefully selected highlights that you spend your life crafting. Third: somebody is your “friend” if you regularly look at their edited highlight reels, and they look at yours—this is what friendship means.

&amp;nbsp;

How about Instagram? First: what matters is how you look on the outside. Second: what matters is how you look on the outside. Third: what matters is how you look on the outside. Fourth: what matters is whether people like how you look on the outside. (I don’t mean this glibly or sarcastically; that really is the message the site offers.)

&amp;nbsp;

I realized one of the key reasons why social media makes me feel so out of joint with the world, and with myself. I think all of these ideas—the messages implicit in these mediums—are wrong. Let’s think about Twitter. In fact, the world is complex. To reflect that honestly, you usually need to focus on one thing for a significant amount of time, and you need space to speak at length. Very few things worth saying can be explained in 280 characters. If your response to an idea is immediate, unless you have built up years of expertise on the broader topic, it’s most likely going to be shallow and uninteresting. Whether people immediately agree with you is no marker of whether what you are saying is true or right—you have to think for yourself. Reality can only be understood sensibly by adopting the opposite messages to Twitter. The world is complex and requires steady focus to be understood; it needs to be thought about and comprehended slowly; and most important truths will be unpopular when they are first articulated. I realized that the times in my own life when I’ve been most successful on Twitter—in terms of followers and retweets—are the times when I have been least useful as a human being: when I’ve been attention-deprived, simplistic, vituperative. Of course there are occasional nuggets of insight on the site—but if this becomes your dominant mode of absorbing information, I believe the quality of your thinking will rapidly degrade.

&amp;nbsp;

The same goes for Instagram. I like looking at pretty people, like everyone else. But to think that life is primarily about these surfaces—getting approval for your six-pack or how you look in a bikini—is a recipe for unhappiness. And the same goes for a lot of how we interact on Facebook too. It’s not friendship to pore jealously over another person’s photos and boasts and complaints, and to expect them to do the same for you. In fact, that’s pretty much the opposite of friendship. Being friends is about looking into each other’s eyes, doing things together in the world, an endless exchange of gut laughs and bear hugs, joy and grief and dancing. These are all the things Facebook will often drain from you by dominating your time with hollow parodies of friendship.

&amp;nbsp;

After thinking all this, I would return to the printed books I was piling up against the wall of my beach house. What, I wondered, is the message buried in the medium of the printed book? Before the words convey their specific meaning, the medium of the book tells us several things. Firstly, life is complex, and if you want to understand it, you have to set aside a fair bit of time to think deeply about it. You need to slow down. Secondly, there is a value in leaving behind your other concerns and narrowing down your attention to one thing, sentence after sentence, page after page. Thirdly, it is worth thinking deeply about how other people live and how their minds work. They have complex inner lives just like you.

&amp;nbsp;

I realized that I agree with the messages in the medium of the book. I think they are true. I think they encourage the best parts of human nature—that a life with lots of episodes of deep focus is a good life. It is why reading books nourishes me. And I don’t agree with the messages in the medium of social media. I think they primarily feed the uglier and shallower parts of my nature. It is why spending time on these sites—even when, by the rules of the game, I am doing well, gaining likes and followers—leaves me feeling drained and unhappy.

nosurf,Heard about this subreddit 3yrs ago and it's only gotten worse,"When I first found this subreddit I was 13 and now I'm 16. And I'm even more unhappy. When I was 13 it was 2020 and then covid hit and I wasn't allowed to go outside. This made my dependency on the Internet even worse as I would just maladaptive daydream the entire day a habit that has followed me to this day. I also went through puberty and now have the body of a young woman. I hate it. I wish I didn't have that. I wish I went through a guys puberty instead. I knew this since 11 but did any adults listen? No. I'm going to do therapy for it know and my mother wants to take it all fucking slow, I don't have time to be slow! My 17th birthday is in April so I only have basically a year and couple of months to try and reap the effects of starting it before puberty. I just wish they'd let me have started therapy at 12 instead of telling me to fuck off whenever I brought it up. Its still effecting me now. Whenever I go outside or to the gym (I've quit now and just use equipment at home) I'm worried everyone's staring at me because I'm obviously a girl pretending to be a guy. I can't even force myself to stand up straight 1) it hurts and 2) it pushes my tits out which is probably why I hunch in the first place. 

Another thing is I wanna be more active but since its winter I can't do shit. Its apparently too icy to put my punching bag back up (its really not) and my bicycle is broke and since its still winter they don't see the point in taking it down to the shop to be fixed. I actually have 2 but i need to replace the brake lever because the ones on the new bike are super small and lose. I don't know how to do that so I'd like to learn but if course the shop doesn't have any courses on it and of course nowhere near where I live has em either ffs!

I'm just kinda ranting now but I feel like I've wasted my life because let's be honest if I don't get to live as a guy soon I don't really see myself making it to 25 or even 21 for that matter. I probably will but I'll just have the days blended together as they've always been. Nothing changes and I hate that the teenage years that were supposed to be fun where so miserable to me and now I've gotta worn for the rest of my life. I'd like to travel or do vanlife but idk if that's possible. I suppose I could bike around with camping stuff but my mind is worried.

I hate the winter, unlike autumn I can't do anything outside anymore and it's all shitty and anything that's exciting to me is outside.",2023-01-22 11:11:44,1674385904

nosurf,I feel like I need to be accessible at all times,"I dropped my phone down the back of a radiator on Friday and my parents were beside themselves trying to get it out (I pay for it and its contract so it wasn't because they have a financial stake in said phone). I wasn't upset that I had potentially lost it for a few days but it feels like I have to be accessible to everyone at all times. Anyway we got the phone back out and I've gone right back to scrolling. I deleted the reddit app on my phone and am making this post on my laptop because I want to be more mindful.

I'd love to get a dumb phone but everyone I know uses WhatsApp to communicate and I always have to be accessible to everyone it feels like! Has anyone had experience at not being accessible to everyone in their life 24/7?

Another thing I have definitely noticed is that if I try to slowly wean off social media by deleting 1 app at a time I just spend more time on whatever app is left! I spend 1 hour on reddit and 10 minutes on instagram, then I delete the reddit app and spend 1 hour on instagram! I keep the instagram app because again I am often messaged by friends on there and don't want to be rude or miss their messages, I feel like I need to be accessible during my work breaks not just at the end of the day.

I don't know if this post is making a huge amount of sense but I've got my screen time down from 6-8 hours a day to 3-4 hours a day from deleting tiktok and being more mindful but I'd ideally love to get my screen time down to just using WhatsApp to reply to messages. It doesn't help that no one else in my life understands why I want to spend less time on my phone so they think I should keep things like twitter and tiktok so I can watch videos, read tweets, join in with whatever is on trend etc.

I'm also trying to do the same for my smartphone and tablet. But with these devices it is harder, because everything is just so easy and convenient to use. That it is very attractive to do something mindlessly and very quickly. To move on to the next thing you wanted to do without the screen.

But, because it's such a short time frame I spent on the device. I get the thought, ah well just one more thing to check. Than I stop and go through my day again without a screen. And before I know it. I have spent way more time on these devices than I intended to do.

This was with non-violent, relatively mildly mentally ill people with no psychosis. We all mainly had severe depression and severe anxiety. I checked myself in so I had the peace of mind of knowing I'd only be there 72 hours.

I had real, meaningful conversations with people of all ages and backgrounds. I wish I could go back there every 6 months. This will be the best $2500 I've ever spent. That's my annual out of pocket maximum. The bill will be much higher. I am so lucky.

I don't necessarily think I have a fear of missing out because I know deep down I genuinly couldn't give a damn about what other people are doing or what's happening around the world. I just don't care. 

I could happily live under a rock for the rest of my life without knowing my left from right. Im extremely introverted and quite the misanthrope. I naturally like to keep myself to myself. 

However, i have another fear. A fear of not being able to engage in conversation. (Even though i hate most conversations as they are pointless/mindless) 

But like normal people, i still have a job to go too, i still have meetings to attend, and i need to chat with people, and even have to do all the small talk malarkey... 

And ive realised the less you know, the more dumb you sound (even though everyone around you sounds more dumb when they are mindlessly chatting about something they have seen on social media OR seen on the news etc...) 

But i find it all exhausting. I would love to just quit it all and avoid the internet *and* conversations with people altogether. But unfortunately, that's not reality. 

Can anyone relate to this and do you have any suggestions?",2023-01-22 06:47:22,1674370042
nosurf,My (nuanced) experience on deleting social media,"Hey everyone!

Wanted to share my experience on deleting social media, especially as a younger guy (mid 20s). 

Over a year ago, right before Dec 2021, I decided to do away with my social media accounts - Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, Tik Tok. The only account/app I kept on my phone was Reddit. I still have a LinkedIn if that counts, but I use that very infrequently, like 10-15 min every few months. 

I decided to delete because like many of us, I felt like life was blowing me by and that none of the digital world really mattered. I was afraid that one day I’d wake up at age 70 and realize how much of my life was wasted on silly videos and Internet drama. 

My positive experiences with my decision include -

1. More time spent reading, and the time I DID spend with screens watching meaningful/impactful films
2. A newfound appreciation for just putting the phone down in mundane situations (lines, car passenger, etc) and observing the world around me 
3. A stronger sense of comfort being alone/in quiet environments 
4. More attention to myself rather than threatening current events. I still stay engaged and informed, but the anxiety doesn’t take up nearly as much space in my head 

However, my social life has taken a serious hit. Like it or not, a large portion of my age group uses social media to meet and befriend others. I moved to Denver around this time and it was very difficult to meet other people my age without the help of Facebook groups (that some of my other friends had luck with). 

It was also tough to keep up with friends I haven’t talked to much since college. I still value these friends and they value me, but life gets in the way and sometimes we can’t talk to those connections as much as we’d like. I was missing some important life updates - engagements, moves, pregnancies, etc. 

I think I’ll download Facebook again soon and try to find a healthy balance between using it excessively and using it as perhaps it was originally intended. I’m glad I cut off social media when I did, but ultimately it’s hard to ignore the fact that it is the preferred communication method for my demographic.",2023-01-22 02:55:38,1674356138
nosurf,Instagram and reddit hack,"So I know it’s ironic that I’m posting this to reddit, but I have a tip that’s helped me to significantly reduce the time I spend on here and IG.  

It’s pretty simple. Instead of telling yourself you’ll delete the apps and go cold turkey, delete the apps and still let yourself use the platforms, just on mobile web instead. 

I’ve found that the interface and layout on mobile web is so clunky and annoying to use, that I’m able to quickly check IG or reddit without getting stuck in the loop of mindless scrolling because it’s less enjoyable.  

It’s been a few days now and this has really helped me cut my screen time down, hopefully this works for someone else!",2023-01-22 00:50:49,1674348649
nosurf,"What are your thoughts on watching tv shows/movies/netflix etc? Apart of me wants to quit and do something more productive like read more books, and learn a new instrument etc..

Don't get me wrong, perhaps ONE night per week sitting down and watching a good movie is OK! But watching telly every single night...... feels like im wasting my life away.

nosurf,My favorite advice regarding no surf,"Credit to : @/memen2-mori on tumblr, I highly recommend her blog.

## Logging Off 

* As always, I suggest reading Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport 
* Take an audit of all of your social media accounts and internet habits. Ask yourself why you use them so much.
* Think of all the things you ""don't have time for"" on your to-do list or list of goals. Imagine if you had 2,3,4+ more hours a day to get them done. How much would your life improve? Your self esteem? Your overall happiness? Your bank account, perhaps?
* Understand that FOMO is stupid and you're not missing out on anything. Oh no, you haven't seen that meme or missed that tweet that was viral for 12 hours! Oh the horror!!! You missed celebrity selfie #22977, oh how can you live with yourself!! 
* Tell your friends to text you rather than DM'ing you. Call your family members and catch up for real, rather than just occasionally perusing their profiles. Better yet, go visit people in person. Your bond will be significantly stronger than if you just exchange memes and likes sometimes.
* Most people start with app timers or blockers. I used to recommend them, but I don't anymore. Not when you're first getting started. I think a proper detox for at LEAST a week is necessary. But honestly, if you've been addicted to the internet for several years, a week won't be enough. You need a detox of a month (or longer). Once your detox ends, that is when I recommend to use blockers/timers.
* Log off, and don't come back until your 30 days is up.

## Staying Logged Off

* You can't just log off and then....stare at a wall??? You need to fill your newfound time with something to do. 
* First, make a schedule for your day. Have some structure in your life. Do the things you said you were gonna do, when you said you were gonna do it. No more guessing about your day. Make a schedule.
* Add in more exercise, cleaning, maintenance of your physical appearance, studying, music practice, language learning, get to those online courses you saved, go visit people, take a class, read some books, pick up sewing, get back to drawing or painting, the list goes on and on. Have a mix of things you can do indoors and outside of the home. Easy low-effort things like having a book to grab at a moments notice, and more effort-needing things like extensive workouts. Basically, have a plethora of hobbies to fill your days. So many hobbies that take up time that you won't even be able to do them all in one day. You will have a full life. 
* Read up on the dangers of extended internet/social media usage. Read about snapchat dysmorphia, how being exposed to ads all day hurts us, the rise of mental health crises in our overly-plugged-in generation.

## Being Happy In the Real World 

* Once you get rid of the compulsion to visit those apps/websites because you've gone long enough without accessing them, you won't think about it much. You'll have so many more important and interesting things going on that mindlessly scrolling won't be so appealing anymore. 
* But don't stop there. Keep expanding your horizons and finding more things to have an abundant life. Making new friends, dating, leveling up your skills, etc. Life can and will just get better and better and better. 
* You may find that you want to forgo some internet spaces completely and just delete those accounts. Great! For the ones you do decide to return to, set a schedule. An hour a day? Unlimited time but ONLY after you've completed your to-do list? Only online on the weekends? Find what works best for you. 
* Remember that existing only online is miserable. If your internet goes out and you are forced to be disconnected for a few hours, what's your life like? What do you have for yourself? Do you have friends that aren't pixels on a screen? Do you have achievements besides your 500 followers?",2023-01-21 20:58:14,1674334694

nosurf,Social media teaches people to coddle themselves and never move past their comfort zones.,"Every slightly upsetting thing gets repackaged as 'trauma'. People don't know how to regulate themselves emotionally and instead, opt to severely overshare on public platforms. 

People find solace in being victims. Mental illness is now a joke. I understand people use humor to cope, but there's nothing cute about being ill. Every once-in-a-while people find a new mental illness to glamorize and make their entire personality. 

I see so many people- but especially children and teens my age- who blatantly sexualize &amp; objectify themselves with no thought of the repercussions. Everything is a competition: who's the most miserable, attractive, successful, flawless, et cetera. 

Absolutely zero authenticity. It seems like everyone just grabs bits and pieces of one anothers personality and mushes them together in an attempt to recreate each other &amp; what they deem as 'perfect'. 

Don't even get me started on the beauty standards. So many people find new flaws about themselves &amp; others that they'd never thought of before. Children get exposed to pro-anorexia communities and give themselves organ damage before they're 18. 

The most uncanny thing? Almost everyone looks the same. It's always fox eyes, small noses, full lips, clear skin, sculpted faces, hairless &amp; blemishless hourglass figures, straight white teeth symmetrical faces, I could keep going.

And the drug use. I know it’s always been a romanticized thing but holy shit. I thought our generation learned that any drug besides weed &amp; psychedelics (in moderation) is anything but okay.

Basically everyone I used to know would smoke heavily and couldn’t go a few minutes without their vape or lighting a bowl. People refuse to admit that needing weed to eat, sleep, shit, &amp; regulate their mood is an addiction. Nobody takes the health implications seriously. 

All-in-all, when I have kids they won’t get any digital devices until they’re 18.",2023-01-21 09:35:17,1674293717
nosurf,what's a good alternative for a creative/artist/written outlet?,"i don't have social media except reddit, but even this platform aggravates me because of the behaviour it encourages, how angry and rude folks on here can be..

my problem is, i want a creative outlet to share my process making traditional crafts (made entirely of materials i harvest myself from the lands i live on). i know i'm doing special things almost no one else out there is doing. such extremely niche things (like..tanning hides with peat bogs..and spinning silk from wild giant silkmoth cocoons) that i cannot even find internet spaces for them, anyway. and i do share them with folks in real life all the time, so it isn't a matter of me being lonely or friendless. as an example, i just taught a class around a fire circle on fish skin tanning two days ago, and it went wonderfully despite being my first time teaching!

but, somehow, it's not ""enough"". i love sharing the basics of skills with newbies to my interests, but i have gone too deep into my work that i desire to connect with others who are ""on my level"" in terms of, they're also doing very creative unique crafts with the land they live on. i can definitely find people who are doing that, but they usually aren't available to have an entire friendship built around this commonality. i've sought tons out. in the past month alone i've gone hide scraping with some folks, weaving with others, making natural paints, i also carved some spoons. why am i so hungry for more?!

i don't know what i want. i guess i long for the cerebral exchange of ideas. as much as doing the real activities of crafting with others. there's an itch that can't be scratched by doing activities alone, or speaking with people alone. i think..i want to WRITE about them too, together with others, for some weird reason. i fill up notebooks like crazy but it doesn't really satiate me because no one else will read them.. i hardly take pictures anymore, but i want to start taking at least a few pictures again and then accompany them with writing. i don't know why. in this way, social media very slightly becomes re-appealing , but not really. i know it would make me miserable and i don't even have a functional phone anymore anyway.

what are my options for fulfilling this desire i have? or should i not fulfill it and just sit with the discomfort? i guess that's what most folks did in the past. in a way, what i'm seeking is validation and ego stroking. maybe this is my version of lingering effects from social media use throughout my teen years.

should i start scrapbooking? get a penpal? start writing books?",2023-01-21 05:50:01,1674280201

Or whatever shows up when you aren't logged into the website.

I find stupid people making stupid posts on those subs and occasionally comment. This then leads the stupid person to post back and I get sucked into the website. I attempted to block people after responding to knock off the back and forth, but even that doesn't work because these people are either paid shills or have no life and inevitably have another account they use to continue the argument.

It is quite obvious this website is filled with both children with little to no life experience or paid shills who are pushing some agenda. Both make very stupid takes on this website.

How do I get not sucked into this website. I have tried everything. I want to avoid logging in because I want to avoid posting unless it is something SPECIFICALLY I need to ask about with a specific hobby or topic. 

I have tried everything all the way up to blocking the website on my router. But I inevitably find a way around that by using some other means. I make the excuse that ""it will only be for this quick break"" and then get sucked in again.

It is obvious this site and other social media sites use algorithms to get you addicted to staying on their websites. Its pretty much been proven at this point.

Does anyone have some real advice on how not to get sucked into this crap? Also, somehow I probably need to replace whatever I am doing on this website with something else during breaks during work or other things. But hard to find something equivalent.

It’s actually sad to see my roommate come home, plop down, and infinite scroll on insta for 2-3 hours straight, mostly looking at ads (sponsored and non-sponsored). Social media has so much potential, it should help us accomplish something we intentionally set out to do. I’ve found that my relationship with social media and the internet more broadly has become less intentional. I no longer use it with a specific purpose in mind. Rather, I use it when I have a moment of free time and find myself getting sucked into conversations I don’t care about.

I have become obsessed with Reddit.  Scrolling when I am bored on phone or on computer.  Writing sex stories to attract eye balls, and thereby exploiting the women I have loved.

Don't worry I will delete those stories as soon as this is posted so I don't cause any relapses.

I keep telling myself I'm not as bad as those other guys.  It's not like I am forking over thousands of dollars to Only Fans models.  It's not like I'm cheating on my wife.  It's not like I am abusing my son.  It's not like I'm actually hurting anyone.

But I am.  By not prioritizing my wife and kid, I am hurting them.  By not giving them all of my love and attention, I am breaking the vows I made them.

By not allowing myself to spend portions of my freetime studying and reading books, I am not loving myself.

nosurf,NEED HELP!!! IDK HOW TO HELP MY BF WITH INTERNET ADDICTION,"Hello, my boyfriend has a problem with internet addiction. He finds himself mindlessly consuming youtube videos and he wants to spend his time on more important things. According to him, his environment makes it easy for him to relapse on youtube, porn, and reddit. He has no much of a choice but to be in his room, in front of his computer because he also works from home. He's been trying different things such as extension blockers, he's been trying to follow a time-blocked schedule, and meditation to be more mindful but he still finds himself failing. I understand that being better is not a linear process and I don't know how to help him properly. We just had a fight a while ago because we were supposed to spend time but he adjusted the time last minute to watch more youtube videos and I agreed. He set another time to meet but he didn't show up on time because of the same reason. I was upset because I have work in a couple of hours and he said these (context: i'm a working student): 

""I mean I know this sounds weird but if I have work and college on my plate, I would actually be able to do things better and actually set priorities better and also lessen the mindless consumption cus it’s easier to keep the motivation snowball going, but that’s for a different discussion — not trying to use that as an excuse for why I’m failing jn""

I am a conscientious guy who want to enjoy the life doing wholesome and meaningful activities and being a well-rounded person. there are certain topics such as life skills, etc. that you can't find anywhere except for reddit. even when it comes to simple stuff such as washing your clothes the proper way, gardening, photography, etc. the quality of stuff you find on reddit is simply unmatched in my opinion. more honest and to the point info vs what you find in a curated article. I have this FOMO about these sorts of information and knowledge if I stop browsing reddit. Like today, I was browsing /r/books and one guy was talking about how he encountered the word ""susurration"" first time in his life in this book he was reading and it was a fun convo going on in the comment section. Now I also learned about this word just off of this conversation. If It wasn't about reddit, I would never come across candid conversations about stuff I enjoy (such as words, being a vocabulary nerd).

nosurf,opinion: tik tok is chasing people off their app,"I know one of the reasons tik tok is so addictive is because it has such a good algorithm, but I really think the model where you are watching videos primarily from people you don’t follow and have little control over what content pops up will ultimately shoot the app in the proverbial foot. 
The biggest reason I got off of tik tok wasn’t that it was a time suck, but that I would accidentally see really distressing content that would ruin my mood for the afternoon and sometimes days. For example, I followed a bunch of cute dog accounts, and would like cute dog posts when they came up on my FYP. But after a bit of that there was always inevitably a video of a dog who was starving, or someone’s dog who got cancer and died, or a video of a dog who needed medical attention and the poster was asking you to watch and interact with the video so they could afford vet bills otherwise the dog would die. I’d have to abruptly close the app and take a mental health break.
Same is true for other things: if you like enough outfit videos, you get one about eating disorders. Funny relationship posts? Eventually you get horrible stories of abuse. Obviously people are entitled to post what they like but it felt like I had absolutely no control over what potentially harmful content came up on my screen.

I am also interesed in debates, argumentation, science and so on. And I do love a good discussion! But I just don't think I should be online anymore... Or at least read any comments ever (I will read yours don't worry!).
You can talk to people about any topic ever and you can do everything you possibly can to have a serious debate about something - but they will just drag you down, ignore all studies, all research, all facts and they will never actually listen, only blabber about their personal experience... And it makes me so mad! I feel like we came back to the dark age in medival times where everybody was just completely blind to science!
I like to debate stuff. I think it is important to meet people with different opinions. It can help you think better, it can help you to understand the other side, it can do milion good things for you, really.
But internet is just filled with so many horrible people... Not only they are obviously stupid, they are also just so rude and full of hate all the time!

I tried to keep my phone out of my sight, only use it when taking a picture or when I really needed it. I don't need to explain it to you all but being present instead of scrolling TikTok every change you got really makes you appreciate and feel the moment more. Especially when you're traveling. Everything is new and different, who doesn't want that moment to last as long as possible?

However, my friends were glued to their phones almost every change they got. 15 minutes of relaxing before going to see another cool spot? Scratch the phone. 5 minute break on the bench before continuing our walk? Scratch the phone. Just woke up and no plans for another 2 hours? Scratch the phone.

That's fine, everyone can spend their holidays however they want. I'm just wondering how much better the holiday would be if everyone was present, enjoying the city and taking it all in while they can instead of filling every even remotely boring moment with their blue screens.

nosurf,Breaking the WhatsApp Addiction: One Simple Method to Take Control of Your Time,"Not a long post, but trust me this will work! I tested this method for about 2 weeks and I was able to decrease my WhatsApp usage to a great extent. 

I tell you to try this as a one-week experiment and compare yourself with the previous week.

&amp;#x200B;

**Benefits you will get!**

1. You will not fall into the infinite WhatsApp status loop.
2. You won't spend time stalking other person's Dp.
3. You won't spend time instantly replying back to friends.   


**What you have to do is,**

1. Disallow access to your contacts from WhatsApp.
2. Remove WhatsApp notifications alerts from the lock screen &amp; Banners. 
3. Turn off badges in WhatsApp notification settings.

&amp;#x200B;

**How to use WhatsApp like this?**

Once you are done with a chat, you can archive it, so if you want to chat with a person, you can search for their name on WhatsApp search so their chat will come up in the dropdown. If the person is not available on the archive, you have to copy their number from the contacts and click on the new message button on WhatsApp and paste it there to start the chat. But this is a one-time thing only. Sometimes a little friction is good.

Develop a mindset like, it is OK not to give instant replies to everyone. Even if they send you a lot of texts on WhatsApp and didn't get any replies from you and if the matter is urgent, they will call on WhatsApp. Trust me, They Will Call. They can understand that you are not seeing the messages, but your internet is ON. So, they will call if the matter is urgent.

**Bonus:** For your dear and near ones maybe your wife, kids or parents, you can set a different notification tone for those selective chats. So you can give higher priority when you hear that notification sounds.",2023-01-19 06:31:08,1674109868
nosurf,One Month of No Home Internet,"One month ago I decided to completely ban the use of Internet at home by storing my personal devices that connect to the internet at work in a secure locker I have access to there. What this meant was that I could still use the internet in emergencies for things like banking, buying stuff online etc but  at home I have nothing but a TV/Radio/Newspapers in terms of access to the outside world. My phone is now a burner phone. I write this post from work, I want to share my findings with you but will likely not interact much with this post at risk of getting sucked back into the redditsphere/internet addiction.

It's been an overwhelming success. **I believe I have broken my endless scrolling habit**  as even when at work, though I could, I have no desire to constantly look at my phone, social media, latest news like I did last month. I actually do my work, what I'm paid to do, which I found incredibly hard to focus on prior to this. And because I can't scroll in the evenings, when I actually get to work and can log on to the internet I have no urge to browse even then. I also used to have an urge to know exactly what the latest news was, I had to be up to date on word affairs. I literally don't care what is going on outside of my life anymore, it's great.

**I have broken my porn addiction.** For the first time since I was a teen I have not watched porn for over a month. This addiction was ruining me. it had to go and could only go by restricting access to the internet in this manner. Of course when I'm at work no way am I watching porn.

**I can actually sit still in a room and just think.** Again, impossible before, could not go more than a minute without a strong urge to pick up my smartphone or browse the internet. My brain has seemingly healed in this regard. I fill a lot of my home time by reading books, thinking, minimal TV. 'And it feels fine. I don't fear boredom anymore. 

**I feel like socializing.** Before I hated socialising, it was a chore because the dopamine hit you get from talking to someone can never ever match the dopamine hit you get from endless internet clicks and things like porn. Now I'm deprived of these things, my brain is begging me to interact with other people as it's one of the few forms of stimulation I have access to. 

To summarize, I feel free. I have broken the spell. I tried restricting apps, tried many of the methods discussed on here but nothing worked. I literally had to get rid of all devices to break free and now a decades long internet addiction finally looks like it is coming to an end.

I'd recommend this method, in the modern world unfortunately for 99% **SOME** access to email/internet is required but if you can store your laptop/smartphone in a safe, remote location such as work or maybe a family members house in case of emergencies it means the majority of your spare time will be spent internet free. **Having a laptop/smartphone in your home is like a crack addict having a crack pipe and his fix in his home, sooner or later you're going to pick it up and use it.**",2023-01-18 22:54:58,1674082498
nosurf,I woke up at 6:30 this morning and it is now 1:30 in the afternoon,"I have the day off from a job I just got but really don’t like and should look for another one,

I’m angry about inequality and oppression,

I’m sad about being unkind to someone who was also unkind to me and not realizing the mutual transgression until after over-apologizing, and am really feeling how I’ll never get a chance to have an honest exchange about it,

yesterday I heard my ex got married and I don’t even like him but my loneliness from the above has compounded itself,

I’ve been having nightmares about my mother, who I am not in relationship with and generally survives in my psyche as a terror,

Generally unhappy, afraid, and feeling bad,

not that it always takes this particular level of stakes for me to stay in bed scrolling, toggling through apps, making my brain a void, seeing things that deeply disturb me and send me spiraling deeper, judging people who will never see my opinion because for one I don’t even share it, seeing things that make me feel like a worse person, seeing good things that make me sad there’s not more of it around, learning things that are interesting but I know I will forget because that’s just how it works around here, etcetera

all I’ve done with these hours is lose my mind looking at a screen until it literally hurts

I have not eaten, I have not drank water, I have held myself back from going to the bathroom until the last possible second (I live in a box, it ain’t far),

even now I’ve made it to sitting on the edge of my bed, no longer under covers, but still not moving, still on here.

This is obviously all mostly due to depression but holy shit my relationship to my phone is literally heavy right now. I can physically feel it. I haven’t been enjoying anything about this activity for at least five hours and holy shit just realized it’s been a full work day !

Just wanted to post a portrait of a woman losing this particular battle, not sure if this is the right place, but,

nosurf,I am just now realizing that you really don’t have to message people back instantly. It’s allowed me to detach value from my phone because I used to view my phone as my friends.,"Hopefully this makes sense! So I’m off all social media, that part I successfully did. But the texting friends really got to me because I started to see texting as the only way to connect.

In the past, up until very recently, I was one of those people where if I was feeling a bit down or bored or lonely, I’d shoot off a bunch of texts to like 10 different friends and it felt good to get a response. These are people that I truly felt close to and that we messaged frequently but when it came to 8 pm after work and I was just home watching tv I’d have to have my phone within arms reach at all times incase a friend texted, so I could respond as FAST as I possibly could. 

Doing this made me feel more lonely because my friends would often take hours and hours to reply or just like 30 minutes and I’d feel lonely waiting for it, so I’d keep my phone so close so I could reach it and get that quick social hit from it.

Just recently I started realizing that no one responds to me immediately, and no one is sitting around waiting for me to text them. They’re doing other things or are out with family or are even just doing a hobby, I had no hobbies and would just watch tv most nights.

Now when I get home from work, I put my phone next to the door and won’t check it until 9 pm if I can help it. If it’s important they’ll call, otherwise it literally can wait and I guarantee no one is waiting on me to text them!

Start doing the same, it’s life changing to come back to your phone after 3 hours and realizing how unimportant a Snapchat or a text is and how it could have waited.",2023-01-18 16:10:15,1674058215

Today (it's already 7:15pm where I live) I spend 5 hours and 46 minutes on my phone and on the internet.
Yesterday was 6h 56min. Sunday it was only 3h 16 min, though I studied for an exam that day. Thursday was 8h 5min and Wednesday was my peek with 9h 25min (!!!) of screentime with only Reddit being 4h 35min of it and YouTube is about 2h. And this doesn't even include time spend on streaming services which I watch on my laptop.

I was shocked, this is so much worse than I thought and with this revelation I think it's pointless to deny that I very much have an internet addiction. I need to stop this right now and turn my life around because this is seriously unhealthy. I don't want to just fully quit socal media and internet since I engage in a lot of my interest there that I don't have anyone to share with, but I definitely need to seriously cut this screentime down.

I never really had a social life (partly why I turned to the internet), so that's not a part of my life that's effected by it, but my collage results are definitely suffering because of this.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a wild idea: instead of buying unique clothing to protect ourselves from 5G, how about we use our devices a little less? I know, I know... it sounds crazy. But think about it. Less screen time means less radiation exposure. Plus, you'll have more time to do other things, like go outside, talk to real people, and even read a book!

The World Health Organization  states that """"to date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use."""" But more research is needed to fully understand the impact of 5G on our health.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not a big conspiracy fan, but it's not impossible that higher frequency radiation emitted by 5G towers could negatively affect our health, including an increased risk of cancer. Still, for now, the impact it has on boosting industries such as healthcare, transportation, and education, while also bringing internet access to more remote and underserved areas seems to be worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what do you all think? Is 5G protection clothing going too far? Are there other products out there that can protect us from the harmful effects of 5G? I'm open to hearing your thoughts and opinions, and please don't judge my questions! Let's discuss!",2023-01-17 16:08:14,1673971694

nosurf,Dumbphones / Feature Phones,"Since the question seems to come up a lot- you probably should get a phone that is just a phone.

Mine personally is a nokia flip phone from walmart. It was like $40. But I think you can find it online for less. My phone bill is $30/month on the Straight Talk plan. I have next to no data. 100 mb/ month or just enough to google a few phone numbers. It even has maps if i really need it. just look up step-by-step directions instead of having it track you the whole time. that uses too much data.

The one I would buy for my kid or my dad who has NO CLUE how to use a smartphone:

Easyfone Prime A6. Call, text, contacts, notes, calculator. That's it. And the charger is a base plug-in thing like a ""cordless"" phone from the 90s. No camera. No chance s/he's gonna send pics they shouldn't be sending. Not on a phone you paid for, at least. 

It's compatible with Tmobile/Mint Mobile

(Edit: I just looked up the a6 and it's sold out on Amazon. There are other options in the Easyfone brand that are comparable and still around \~$70.)

Here's an article on the ""best"" dumbphones- some are ridiculous- like $400 lmao

nosurf,"does anyone else use social media, specifically instragram, like this?","I've heard some people call it ""post and ghost"" but that's moreso people using social media for business means. but I basically do the same thing, minus the scheduled posts. I'm a drummer so I use my IG profile as a portfolio of sorts, to showcase bits of my drumming. other than that I don't really ""use"" instagram.

\- I don't have the IG app downloaded on my phone. When I do check IG, I use the clunky mobile browser site - makes it easy to not extend my stay 

\- I don't look at my feed **at all** anymore. the thing is, if we are true friends then being informed about most things via an IG post doesn't feel as personal as a face to face convo, text, or phone call. I'm basically being grouped with homegirl over there that you met twice and have never had a full convo with, or homeboy over there that you went to high school with that you haven't talked to in 5 years. they all get access to that same information, in the same way me, your actually friend, received access to it. doesn't make sense imo

\- I don't post anything about my personal life anymore. all I post is my drumming, and occasionally a screenshot of a song I'm listening to lol. I used to post on my story about things in my life that ideally only a friend should know about lol. Access to my life is a privilege, and I feel that by openly sharing a bunch of stuff on your social media, you kinda lose a mystery about you. also I've literally had a lot more friends text or call me to check in because they can't know what I'm up to passively via social media, they have to get the information from the source. 

\- every few days to a week I'll check my DMs (really wish IG had a standalone Messenger app)

\- I don't check for likes or comments anymore. I'll download the app to post a drum video then delete it immediately after. I'm using my IG profile as a portfolio for myself, so likes and comments don't matter. (feels so good)

\- I don't like the whole ""everyone is a brand now"". like I get it, but it's still annoying. some people have this elevated self importance about them. you can see it when you follow someone and they unfollow you to keep their ratio a certain way, or just the stuff they post. everyone has ""fans"" now. the thing that takes me out the most is when people are like ""did you see my instagram post?"" lol. if I'm not important enough to you to directly receive the information you put in a post, then I don't need to know. I had a rude awakening some months ago when I realized I was doing some of the same things, and I shut all that down real quick.

\- the way I was using IG was so anxiety inducing, and attributed to FOMO often. everyone is posting about this event they're hosting next week, or this function happening tomorrow. it's impossible for our brains to even fully process all that information. it's also impossible to go to every single function, so there's no point in trying to keep up with it all. the irony is since I've stopped trying to socially keep up with the joneses, my social calendar has been packed and I've been having so much quality fun, versus when I'd lurk on my IG feed trying to look for the next event ""everyone"" was gonna go to.

Those who would organize us according to permanent individual functions and permanent individual restrictions condemn the human race to move at much less than half-steam.

I come to realize that the reason why my attention span and problem solving skills has weakened greatly over the past few years was because I gave in entirely to social media after experiencing my worst state of depression. I had no motivation, and that was all I needed to become addicted to social media. 

Before that I used to hate social media including smart phones and was hesitant on getting my first one but ended up having to get one back in 2011 just cause my mother wanted one for her self so she used me for a new account. But now that I feel I'm finally able to pick myself up again, I've noticed my attention span is severely poor that it's started concerning me.

nosurf,I Made Smart Website Blocker for FireFox using AI,"\# The Extension

&amp;#x200B;

\[Stay Focused for Firefox\]([https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stay-focused-ff/?utm\_content=addons-manager-reviews-link&amp;utm\_medium=firefox-browser&amp;utm\_source=firefox-browser](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stay-focused-ff/?utm_content=addons-manager-reviews-link&amp;utm_medium=firefox-browser&amp;utm_source=firefox-browser))

&amp;#x200B;

\## How Does It Work?

&amp;#x200B;

This extension uses an AI to quickly and accurately determine whether a website is entertainment or not by passing the URL to the AI. It adds at most 0.5 seconds to website load time. 

&amp;#x200B;

\## Why Firefox?

&amp;#x200B;

Firefox is continuing to support manifest V2, while Chrome is cutting support for it, making tools like ad-blockers and website blockers less effective. Firefox also has developer API's that make this extension possible.

&amp;#x200B;

\## Why Use It?

&amp;#x200B;

Current website blockers can be too broad and block educational content along with entertainment. This extension allows for more granular blocking, for example, blocking youtube/gaming but not youtube/science.

&amp;#x200B;

\## Getting Started

&amp;#x200B;

1. Install the extension.
2. Add your OpenAI API key to the extension's input. Get your API key from \[here\]([https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys)).
3. input the key in the extension pop-up, the extension will tell you if the key is valid.
4. The extension will work from there on

&amp;#x200B;

\## Plan For The Future

&amp;#x200B;

This is a rough version 1 of the extension. Upcoming improvements include:

&amp;#x200B;

\-   Speed improvements. There are lots of optimizations that can be made inside the code

\-   Toggling the extension on and off in the extension pop-out

\-   Adjusting filter strictness

\-   Custom prompts for blocking website of specific classifications

\-   A fine-tuned model for even more accurate classification, which I will probably have to charge for to cover server costs.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know if this is something that you would be interested in on the extension page or here.",2023-01-15 22:50:08,1673823008

nosurf,Who are you when no one is watching?,"As soon as you are alone, what do you do? They second they walk out the door, do you reach for your phone? Do you open your computer? Do you do something you later regret? And why is that? Personally, I find that as soon as I am alone, my brain goes ""oh, now we can binge and no one can see us"". Then later, I lie about my use.

It's much easier for me to do the right thing when I am with others. It's like seeing a functioning person reminds me that I need to function too. But it's also that I am trying to keep up the illusion that I do not have problems. What this means is that I feel like I've made progress sometimes, but it was really just because I had not been alone in a long time. 

Does anyone else have this experience? Who are you when no one is watching? 

Secondarily, isn't it true that if we live mindfully, there is always someone watching? When you live mindfully, you are conscious and aware. You are watching. And perhaps that will help us to do the right thing. I think the issue for me most of the time is being stuck in a mindless trance.

nosurf,Using AVRT to combat internet addiction,"[https://youtu.be/S53OjsF3z-w](https://youtu.be/S53OjsF3z-w)

I am sharing this video series because I really believe its the answer to addiction. Its slow at first but it will blow your mind. Dont be fooled by its old appearance. Its the most amazing answer to addiction I have ever come across. Its not any old nonsense, I have a suspicion that you will come to love it as I do.

Heres a short summary: Addiction occurs when you let your midbrain make the decisions instead of your neocortex. The midbrain is the primitive survival part of the brain which has associated your addiction with survival and the neocortex is the thinking and rational you. First lesson in AVRT is to make the distinction between the neocortex (YOU) and the midbrain (IT). Then we learn what ambivalence is and why we seem to want to simultaneously quit and continue using. We will learn that ambivalence is caused the presence of the addictive voice (the midbrain speaking to you). You will see that the addictive voice is actually powerless over you. Then you will learn some basic techniques how to shut up the midbrain. Its all about detection. If you detect the addictive voice, it disappears. But its a skill you learn. For example, one thing we dont do is white-knuckling. This means arguing with the addictive voice. If you do, it has you. Just recognize it, then choose what YOU desire instead of what the midbrain desires.

I have been doing it for a while for pornography addiction and its been wildly succesful for me. I am just coming around to start using it for internet addiction.",2023-01-15 08:17:59,1673770679

nosurf,what mindless scrolling does to you - video recommendation,"Don't know if this has already been posted here before, but I wanted to share this video which focusses on boredom and mindless media consumption.

[what mindless scrolling does to you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEQTrW9NP68)

It's a well researched and nuanced video about what mindless scrolling does to our mind and why we feel unhappy doing it. 

One of my favorite qutoes from the video: ""What I've learned is that there is a difference between passively scrolling and having a meaningful interaction with your smartphone. I think it's about recognizing passively scrolling as a type of boredom that we might not intuitively notice and try and seek more meaningful connection, whether that's on your smartphone or in real life. I know that I've laughed the hardest I've ever done in my life at some of the videos that I've watched online. And I've had the most meaningful conversations with people online. But I also know that I spend a lot of time just passively scrolling disengaged from what's in front of me. And I think I need to get better at recognizing when I'm doing the latter.""

So it's all about intent and mindfulness.

nosurf,The clock as the root of tech dissociation,"In *Program or Be Programmed* by Douglas Rushkoff, the first of the ten commands (as in commands for programming a computer) to take control of the biases of digital media, is time. No doubt in his studies Rushkoff was aware of what Lewis Mumford wrote in *Technics and Civilization* in the 30's about the clock and its role in history:  


&gt;*..by its essential nature it dissociated time from human events and helped create the belief in an independent world of mathmatically measurable sequences: the special world of science.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Abstract time* ***became the new medium of existence****.* *Organic functions themselves were regulated by it: one ate, not upon feeling hungry, but when prompted by the clock: one slept, not when one was tired, but when the clock sanctioned it.*

I get the sense that .. we have lost a sense of natural time, so that this unnatural abstraction has replaced it. And then people proceed to measure how well they do Nosurf or addiction recovery based on this unnatural framework, just measuring in terms of more or less time spent, perhaps never questioning the basic frame of reference itself.

So what would it look like if instead of spending less time online, it shifted to a matter of not measuring time by the clock?

One of the more obvious things that a lot of people can probably relate to is the primacy of the circadian rhythm over arbitrarily imposed schedules. Of course we have to use the clock for work and the like, but it can be arranged in a way that doesn't disturb our sleep cycles.

Some people try to stick to a schedule and be disciplined, but doing it without having any real sense of what your body needs is going to be arbitrary and potentially in conflict, trying to get up at 4am every day when you have been pulling all nighters binging past that time on a regular basis or insisting on the philosophy that you can will yourself into any schedule, not as a qualified exception but a rule. That kind of go get'em philosophy seems to also function on dissociating time from human events, biasing the willpower of the mind. Instead of following abstracted time that kind of philosophy seems to just follow abstracted philosophical principles and ignore reality.",2023-01-14 03:36:24,1673667384

nosurf,I was the happiest I've been in my life up until 2012,"I am 22, I was born in 2000 and I remember my early years up until late 2012 I had so much wonder and curiosity within me.

Then moving to high school in 2011 things started to change, admitted this happens naturally to everyone when you start to enter adolesence but I noticed after the first year when I entered the second year everything flipped on it's head, I discovered social media through friends got my first Facebook account started following friends and it warped my whole perspective on life, I started feel the need to compete with others to impress people in my year group, to follow the crowd, to shape myself into something I was not. That was just the start, I eventually found porn and fell into that vicious cycle which harms me to this day. 

That need to be liked mutated into crippling anxiety that has plagued me so much since then and now looking back it all started with discovering social media and the internet. It's ironic because I felt I had to have social media for the fear of missing out, but I was actually missing out on life itself and all it's joy and wonder. 

Social media has given me nothing of value in all my years of using, but what it has given me is; fear of not being liked, chasing validation, body dysmorphia, not feeling good enough, constant feeling of sadness etc

We see the world through the lens of someone who just wants to consume. We see everything that happens around us as either interesting enough to take us out of the moment or not interesting enough to do so. How do you feel after you've been surfing the internet mindlessly for hours and hours, trying to find some form of ""pleasure"", anything to take you out of the moment? Drained. Irritable. All-around awful. And even if that internet use was not directly engaging with social media, you probably have nothing left in the tank after. You scoured for more and more, until there was nothing left, feeling as desolate and barren as a dry desert. 

You then avoid socializing because it's not as immediately satisfying as the digital de""vices"", and when you're forced into social situations you feel distracted, exhausted, and like you don't care. The people around you become like the characters on your screen. They either please you enough to keep around, or they don't. And they likely don't, because your baseline for what feels good is limited to the best of the best. The biggest and the brightest. It's the worst kind of trance to be in. You can't endlessly scroll in real life, but in those moments, you wish you could. 

Plus, why would you want to be around other people when you feel self-loathing? After long periods of time where you avoid living your life, caught up in the digital darkness, why would you want to show your face? Personally, i never feel more shame, guilt, and self-hatred then after binging until I break. It's a vicious cycle. I've been caught in it for many years. I hate who I become when I use mindlessly. 

It's hard to see clearly how these things impact us in the moment, but no matter who your are, at some point you realize that something is very, very wrong.

I just want to do right by myself. I have one life. I've squandered so much of it, stuck in the mindlessly purgatory, but today I am here right now and I intend to do right. Not just for me. For all of us. We are all stuck on this planet together, and we need to do right by each other. I hope one of you connects with something I've said and I wish you all the very best on your journeys.

Peace",2023-01-13 16:37:10,1673627830
nosurf,Just deleted my old Reddit account and kinda regretting it. Advice?,"Deleted my old &amp; original Reddit account 2 days ago and deleted 50k post karma that was included. 

Not gonna deny, part of me semi regrets it because I did enjoy going through some of my old post history to refresh some things I asked and learned but I had a nagging urge to just delete my account and without thinking I did.

I could’ve taken the time to just go through all the useless subs and unsub from them and only keep the ones I was getting value but I also was embarrassed of things I said on that account when I was younger that I don’t really feel fit me anymore and did not want to be stuck with the stigma of it.",2023-01-13 00:42:51,1673570571
nosurf,My history of gaming/Youtube/internet addiction :: I'm slipping back into the cycle.,"Once later into my ninth grade year I had let my dogs loose to play in the yard. For context, I live on my grandparent's pecan farm so they had a lot of space to run around. There was one issue though, both of my dogs were beagles and there were no boundaries to keep them from leaving the land. 

After letting my dogs out I anxiously went inside to continue playing some video game on my PC. I came back outside maybe 10 minutes later to find that both of my dogs were nowhere in sight. I felt so pissed and pathetic at the time that I swore off playing video games. I knew that I was horribly addicted (as I had been from ages 11-14)  and having had both of my dogs take off running unsupervised due to my addiction was a big blow to my ego. Luckily a neighbor who lived near our land put them on some leashes and found us. The dogs were okay, in fact, they were having a blast.

I picked up reading in lieu of playing games, my first book (ironically) was Cal Newport's Digital Minimalism. I began to replace all of the time I spent playing video games and watching Youtube reading books. Many of them were self-help books, as I would usually have some spurts of depression or anxiety throughout my teenage years. I wasn't too crazy about reading, but it was better than doing nothing at all. I had also begun my first year at a public high school for 10th grade, and with my new habit of consistent reading, tackling mundane schoolwork had been the easiest it's ever been.

COVID hit while I was in 10th grade and I spent the majority of my second semester doing school work at home. I was still very in control of my technology habits, and I had actually begun allowing myself to play just an hour a day of video games at a specified time to better practice self control. It was later during the year that a new coworker had begun to work alongside me, and that coworker was also a female around my age. 

My mother disapproved of her because A: Her family had patterns of drug use, and B: She was the same race as her deadbeat husband. This spurred my intense hatred and rebellion against my mother as she tried to take steps preventing me from seeing her again. I began to indulge in watching Youtube videos and TV for hours at a time just to help me stay up later so I could sneak out and see her when my mom fell asleep. This gave the addictive engine in my mind enough gas to start and I once again became hooked to the internet/Youtube videos. My grades began to suffer at school while I was spending most of my time home trying to watch Youtube while doing homework and failed miserably. It also didn't help that I was running on 3 or less hours of sleep most nights either looking for a window of opportunity to sneak out my window.

After being caught sneaking out one too many times, my mom sent me to Texas where my grandpa lived on his newly purchased ""ranch"" (15 acres of land he put his house and 4 equine on). There, I lived in his old camper he and his wife lived in before their house was built. I had never felt more free. The rules were simple, I could call and text my girlfriend for as long as I wanted until 9pm, by then the phone had to be on the kitchen counter in the house. I had no issue with this system, and I had even brought my 2DS with me to Texas and was able to reinstate the habit of ""An hour a day"". I had once again been able to grasp the reigns of my addictive personality.

I had only lived in Texas with my grandpa for about 5 months when it was time for me to go back and finish off my 10th grade year back in my previous school. By the time I was home, my addiction crept back in and I was glued to my screen within the month of my return. I remained this way through my 11th and 12th grade years at school, the worst of it being the one and a half month of summer after graduation where I had quit my job and was spending the majority of my time in my bedroom playing on my PC. I was severely depressed and having suicidal ideations but with little desire to act on them (as the thought of how it would affect my little sister was a strong motivator against it). 

It was in the middle of that summer that I left for Fort Jackson to do basic combat training in order to join my state's National Guard. During BCT I had jabbered about videogames with my fellow enlistees to help pass the time. After graduation there was a 3 day intermission in which I was allowed to spend at home until I left for Fort Lee to do my job training. Those three days were a clear indicator that I hadn't regained any self control. I played videogames and watched youtube for all three of those days, depriving myself of more sleep than my drills did at basic.

Then I arrived at Fort Lee. We were allowed to have our cellphones and I became hooked on CoD Mobile. I was continuing my rotation of ""Game, Surf, Game, Surf"" until about my second week in something sparked in me that said ""The fuck am I doing?"". I had magically regained my self control. I filled white space I had before and after school with reading and meticulous cleaning of my room. I had even gone so far as to make a cleaning rotation list and a daily planner so that I could keep track of how much time I was spending on my screens as well as what needed to be cleaned next. I was once again in control, and I was happy. 

Then, I graduated.

Here I am now, back at the same house where I've felt the best and the worst in my life. Today I was binge watching Youtube while doing all of my chores, making my progress very slow. I had to take 10mg of melatonin and force myself to put my phone up last night just to go to sleep. I don't play Minecraft with my friends anymore because I feel like I'll just continue the cycle of ineffective, distracted work getting me nowhere on our projects. I'm concerned that I'll be falling back into the cycle before leaving for basic training.

I'm not sure what could be going on, and I'm reluctant to seek therapeutic help as I'm trying to get into a senior military academy (not to commission, but to try and get back the discipline I keep losing, I don't really have that big of an interest in the military as a career). It seems as though surfing and gaming is my true kryptonite. I subscribe to the belief that addiction is genetic as there are many of my own family members who have lost many years to alcohol before finding their way out. I feel that the feeling I get seeking quick rushes and using screens to distract me from the mundane is probably similar to the feeling my cousins/parents/grandparents have when they pick up another bottle. Funny enough, I've smoked weed and have done mushrooms many times, yet I feel no pull towards those substances as I do surfing the internet and watching videos. Although, when intoxicated by those substances, I do feel noticeably more drawn towards indulging in screens.

Here I am today, slowly but surely falling back into that hole. Why am I too weak to put the phone down and keep it down now? Sometimes I suspect that I have a subconscious relationship with this house, or even my own mother (with whom I haven't had the greatest relationship with while growing up) that is trying to prevent the opportunity for submerged, traumatic memories to surface in my mind, as I have indeed had many bad experiences that involved my mom and her husband while both drunk. I'm not sure, and I doubt I'm going to figure it out completely while stuck in this godforsaken house and what memories I have here.

nosurf,Don't you miss that feeling?,"When I was younger, when I was less scarred from this, I used to sometimes get this amazing feeling of experiencing a wholly new thing, or just feeling intense pleasure and excitement about an experience. Playing a video game that blows your mind. Watching a movie that transforms your world view. Having a great conversation. Hearing a song like you've never heard before. Etc., etc.,

Now I'm so far down the rabbit hole that I almost forget what that feels like. So many of the days of my life have been spent binging, finding anything that would give me pleasure, anything that took me out of the moment and out of my feelings. Now I just feel numb. I've seen everything there is to see on the internet, pretty much. Nothing surprises me anymore. Anything I used to enjoy, i've gone back to and extracted every last drop out of. I've ruined so many things. And even those things that I enjoy, i'm just on to the next thing. Once the illusion of escape is gone, I need something else to fill the void. And secondly, all of this digital use has changed how I see the world and the people around me. I get irritated if i'm away from my phone for too long. I'm only half-listening when people close to me tell me about their life. Any social event I just try to endure until I can go home and escape again. I've lost any sense of genuine care for others in favour of the escape.

Where I'm at now is that I don't know what it's like to feel genuine pleasure anymore. I'm just trying to survive. And I'm doing so in the most damaging way possible: by trying to avoid and trying to escape. Do any of you know what I mean? Don't you miss that feeling?

It feels like I am stuck down some kind of findom/sexual rabbit hole which I just can't manage to crawl out, no matter how hard I try.. 

The funny thing is, every other aspect of my life is fine. 

I often read people say *find the root cause to your problem and you'll be cured..* 

But im not sure there *is* a root cause. 

I genuinly believe ive just fallen down a weird sexual fetish rabbit hole and i somehow ive lost my way and can't get out. 

It not exactly having a negative impact on my life, I still manage normal things. 

I have a good job, i workout, i train, i hang out with friends and im even luckily enough to have a beautiful girlfriend. 

My girlfriend knows of my problem. In fact, she's even joined me on the site many times for fun. She's not the prude type and is very open minded. 

She doesn't see it as physical *cheating* so has never been bothered by it. 

Don't get me wrong, she doesnt know exactly how much i have spent using the site. That part i have kept private. 

Ive told her i think i have an addiction and she just laughs it off and calls me silly. She doesnt believe i have developed an actual *addiction*

The discovery page is able to let me waste hours on it. I tried a lot. Giving myself a max number of minutes, but after some days, I just increase it unconsciously. Grayscale also has not helped since I sometimes I return to color and forget to turn it back to grayscale. I did not want to delete Instagram since that is how I stay in touch with my friends. Never mind the methods that weren't successful for me. Let me tell you about what did work:

&amp;#x200B;

Reducing the number of accounts I follow. I unfollowed famous people, meme/fun accounts and many others. I also forbade myself to use the discover page ever again. This method lets me see the stuff my friends post, without spending hours on the discovery page. I do the same for snapchat now and it has helped me only look at the snaps people send me and then leave the app.

nosurf,May we all rise from the ashes.,"I've been battling this thing for a long time. Really about 10 years. I've peeked in here on many occasions, usually at the end of a long binge, hoping I suppose that I would be able to apply my fresh self-loathing to the situation.

This might have been a stupid idea, but I decided to create an account here and on discord with the sole purpose of beating the proverbial monster under the bed.

It's hard for me to talk to the people close to me in my personal life, but I hope that can come eventually as well.

There are so many of us struggling with this, and I know that if we can all help each other with the knowledge we have, we can defeat this. Each one of us has learned so many lessons. If we can just remember those lessons, and apply what we learned, well we probably wouldn't be here. Anyways, I just wanted to inject some hopeful words and introduce myself.

nosurf,A few tips to reduce your time on reddit,"I've seen a lot of despair on nosurf recently so I thought I'd share what has been working for me, hopefully it will work for you too.  

I'll keep it short and sweet as you obviously should go do something else. On PC I [used a script](https://old.reddit.com/r/userscripts/comments/8v0amu/autoredirect_good_ol_reddit_oldredditcom/) to force reddit into the old mode whether I'm logged in or not (requires a user script addon like greasemonkey, make sure its enabled in incognito mode).  

Then I blocked the next button at the bottom of the page, also the all, popular and random buttons at the top of the page [using another script](https://pastebin.com/raw/mCwgxVuS).  

The idea being you can browse reddit, but you only get 1 page at a time. It won't stop you and you could go back to mindless browsing by disabling the script, but an ex-smoker could easily bin their vape and buy another pack of 20 too. This way you get a little fix of browsing then hit a missing next page button encouraging you to stop for a while.  

If you want to do this on other websites, you could also block some buttons with an adblock, Adblock plus has a 'Block Element' button, I'm sure the others have something similar. Or you could try editing that script above.  

--- --- ---  

If you browse mobile too, I recommend only subbing to non-addictive subreddits like the ones you see in the sidebar, and if possible delete the popular and all buttons (I know you can on Apollo).   
That way you can still mindlessly browse but you won't lose yourself so easily...also /r/nosurf will probably pop up more often in the feed.  

Hope that helps.",2023-01-11 23:00:39,1673478039
nosurf,How r/nosurf has reduced my internet time,"I’m not really aiming for “no” surf— just much less of the mindless surfing that wastes time. 

I signed up for r/nosurf because it was a recommendation by the Stanford University  [Screentime Genie](https://screentime.stanford.edu)  for reducing screentime and breaking internet addiction.  I laughed at first because they were telling me to go to Reddit when the problem was I was already spending too much time on Reddit.

But it has worked.  Everytime a r\nosurf post shows up in my feed I ask myself, “What am I doing?  Is this what I want to be doing?” With each post I see I take one step to reduce my screentime.  (Screentime Genie was designed by the [Behavior Design Lab](https://screentime.stanford.edu/about) run by  BJ Fogg, the Tiny Habits guy.  So any action I take is going to be tiny. 

At first when I’d see a post, I’d just think about what subreddit I had just spent the most time on and unsubscribe from that.  (r/AmItheAsshole was the first to go). Gradually I unsubscribed from the subreddits that most provoked me.   Now when I see a r/nosurf post — I generally don’t even read them — I ask myself is there something else I can do right now?  Sometimes I keep on scrolling but more often, I use the post as the cue to put the iPad down and do something in the real world.

Not once have I browsed my McDonalds or KFC app just trying to get some interaction out of it, or something similar to what social media was giving me. I keep going on Whatsapp even though I have no notifications, no new messages, just checking over and over again, the same with YouTube, even though there is nothing I particularly wanna watch and I just scroll.

Even though these slip ups only last a few minutes each, rather than the hour-long scrolls I used to have, they are bothersome as they happen frequently - I check around every 10-15 minutes or so. I feel like my mental fog hasnt cleared up because of this, I still cant focus properly and I just feel like a lab rat - going back for more and more and more, even though I know its hurting me.",2023-01-11 18:33:54,1673462034

nosurf,This is it. I’m at my breaking point.,"Every time I am tired, I find comfort in my devices. I can’t face emotions. I can’t cope with life. Years of human evolution are being hacked into by these drugged up devices. I am done, I am rotting and falling apart. I am about to break.

I’m addicted to the internet. I’ve tried quitting probably 25 times in the past 3 years. Every time, I come back even more addicted. 

The cravings build up, and I end up relapsing like a hungry feral dog who just found a bone to chew on.  

I’m tired and my life is passing by me. I know I have the power to quit because I was able to successfully quit gaming cold turkey over 2 years ago.

I was very active on r/stopgaming and ultimately that is what help me quit. Being able to release my pain and suffering on a subreddit with similarly minded people was so helpful. 

If I could find a real life support group, then I would join that instead of posting here. For now, I will be posting and commenting here at least a few times a week until I am past the withdrawal phase of quitting everything else.

I need to quit YouTube, Reddit, random pointless googling and downloading apps and playing around on my phone and taking pictures all the time. I need to learn to treat my devices as I would a paper notebook. It is just a tool, it is not a refuge.",2023-01-11 14:39:03,1673447943

nosurf,How I’ve stayed off social media for over a year," About seven years back, an adorable game was making the rounds on social media. Ten questions to ask your child about you. Our five-year-old answered “what is your mom good at?” She knew this one immediately: “texting on her phone.” Then: “what is your mom not good at?” “Not texting on her phone.” I awkwardly laughed thinking it wasn't that clever. Yet later when alone, I sobbed.

At the age of five, our daughter had identified my addiction. I felt deep shame. I was powerless to control my social media use and my texting. Life had become unmanageable as I stayed up well past midnight, sometimes all night posting and commenting on social media. I’d wake up with next-to-no sleep exhausted. Even though I was the stay-at-home mom, my husband handled the entire morning routine getting the kids out the door.

I searched weekly for a support group and in June of 2020 I found ITAA. “These are MY PEOPLE,” I declared to my husband after the first meeting. I was so very happy to have finally found this fellowship which has become a home to me the last 2 ½ years.

I went to a meeting every day from there forward. Yet, nothing changed, and I didn’t get sober. There’s a recovery slogan: “meeting makers make it,” well, meeting makers who \*only\* go to meetings, don’t. In January of 2021, I really started to work the program. I got a sponsor and began the steps. I made outreach calls. I love ITAA’s outreach calls: if I need support in the moment, I ask and someone calls me. Likewise, I can support another.

My early bottom lines—the specific tech boundaries I use to define sobriety—were around limiting my use: such as only using before 10pm or only going on to social media to visit the district parents’ group. Yet I slipped. Again and again. I wasn’t happy and I certainly wasn’t sober. My usage was very unmanageable, and self-reliance had failed me.

On September 27, 2021, I hit my bottom. That is my wedding anniversary and my husband stayed home from work. He was doing some yard work and then we’d planned to ride our Harley north and have lunch. He finished the yard work. I could tell he was done but I couldn’t pull myself away from social media. Almost an hour later I pulled myself away—we had a rushed lunch to get back for the kids—this was my fault. That evening we had a special dinner to celebrate our anniversary with the kids. Once again, I couldn’t pull myself off social media and didn’t join until dessert.

I felt like SUCH a bad mom. Who does this?!

I was running my life on self-will and I needed to trust something other than myself.

I had a lot of fear and mourning around leaving social media. Yet another ITAA fellow let me know that he had felt that, too. That helped me feel like I could do it and my ITAA friends gave me support.

Yet I can’t stay sober today because of yesterday's recovery. I need to ask for help every day. As I’ve been in the program longer, I’ve discovered new bottom lines. Toughest for me today is over-researching insignificant purchases but I’m working on that with an accountability group of six ITAA friends who have similar issues.

I’ve been quite active in service with the fellowship. I’m excited that we’re so new--only five years. It is a great honor to help create this fellowship which I have craved for years. The camaraderie, support, and love I feel in this fellowship lifts me up daily.",2023-01-10 22:50:12,1673391012
nosurf,No one prepared me for this level of solitude…,"On Christmas Day I decided to delete TikTok, Instagram, Facebook. I use Reddit but only on my laptop. The solitude and feeling of peace is really astounding. My anxiety &amp; sensory overload issues are practically gone. 

While feeling better, I’ve been  uncomfortable, especially the past few days. I finally know what it means to be bored after years of scrolling anytime that bored feeling hit me. I legitimately sit in quiet sometimes now during my work breaks or time alone. I’m an avid reader so I do that but when I’m not reading, it’s so so so so quiet in my brain. I feel a tinge of loneliness. I’m reaching out to some friends on text but sometimes they don’t even text me back. So it’s just me and my thoughts. It’s bitter sweet. It’s both a great and weird feeling. 

I assume that part never changes. The feeling of being more isolated and set apart from society; the quietness in my mind and tinge of loneliness… but I’ll take it over being a social media addict any day. I feel so much more fulfilled at the end of the day despite those uncomfortable feelings.

nosurf,The Hook Model: How Social Media Apps Keep Us Coming Back for More,"Have you ever wondered how social media apps keep you coming back for more? The Hook Model, outlined in Nir Eyal's book ""Hooked"", explains how these apps use certain behavioural loops to keep you engaged and coming back for more. In this post I wanted to take some time to explain how the hooked model works.

The Hook Model consists of four parts: the trigger, the action, the variable reward, and the investment.

The first step is the trigger, which can be either external or internal. External triggers are external cues that prompt us to use the app, such as notifications, or seeing the app icon on our homescreen. For example, you may receive a notification that one of your friends liked your post on Facebook, or a notification that someone has sent you a message on Instagram, leading you to open the app to check.

The next step is the action, which is the simple decision to open the app and interact with it. This can be as simple as tapping on the notification or the app icon to open the app.

The third step is the variable reward, which is the anticipation of something new or exciting within the app. For example, when you open up Instagram, you're not sure what you're going to see on your feed, you might get a notification of a like, a direct message, a new follower, etc. This creates a sense of uncertainty and keeps you hooked.

Finally, the fourth step is the investment, which is the effort you put into the app, such as posting something new on your feed or commenting on someone else's post. This makes you more likely to come back to the app in the future because you have invested time and effort into it.

So, how do we break this cycle? It's quite simple, by reducing the number of triggers. Turning off notifications is an easy way. For me personally, this wasn't enough. I found the app icons itself trigger unconscious usage as well. That's why during my master in Interaction Design I started [Unpluq](https://www.unpluq.com/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=icp-3-2pr-1ns-4) as a way to combat the Hook Model and regain control of my time and attention. Unpluq helps users to break out of these behavioural loops by adding a layer of intentional friction before you can open a distracting apps, this changes phone usage from a mindless habit to a conscious choice.

The Hook Model is a powerful tool that explains how social media apps keep us hooked, by using external triggers &amp; variable rewards. By being aware of this model, you can make more conscious choices about how you use your devices and apps and take control of your time and attention.",2023-01-10 11:06:17,1673348777

nosurf,Small steps,"Hey everyone, I'm sort of coming on here to vent, but I've also been thinking a lot about how common a problem internet addiction is and I wanted to share some stuff that has been working for me. 

I recently accepted that, for me, scrolling TikTok and Instagram is in fact an addiction/coping mechanism rather than just a way to pass time. I have my experience overcoming addictions and my first thought was how I could go about 'weening off' rather than just going cold turkey, which in retrospect sounds stupid but just hear me out. 

A few weeks ago, I bit the bullet and deleted TikTok. It's embarrassing how much of my productivity has been confiscated by that app. In reality though it wasn't the app itself that revoked my attention span, it was my lack of self-control. Within the next few days, I repeatedly opened my phone and clicked on the spot where TikTok used to be. Unfortunately for me, it was no longer on my phone and it's spot on my screen was replaced by Clash of Clans (which I also had to delete because my dumbass would start playing it once I accidentally opened it). 

After I had reduced my screen time a decent amount, I started watching episodes of TV series that I never got to finish. It was kind of difficult at first because I could barely even get through a 20 minute episode without needing some other stimulation but I ended up being able to manage it. This might seem counterproductive as it's just another screen, but it actually helped both my attention span and my daily routine. Rather than scrolling for literal hours before my eyes genuinely ached, I would just watch 2 or 3 episodes of The Office and then go to bed. Last weekend I had the self-control to sit through a movie and not open up my phone. 

I am certainly not perfect but this 'weening-off' method of slowly increasing my attention span has reduced my daily screen time from about 6 hours to around 2-3. Someday soon I hope to achieve less than an hour. Anyway, those are my thoughts.",2023-01-09 23:22:59,1673306579
nosurf,Toxic comment sections,"Lately I've noticed I'm becoming more and more sad and angry with comment sections on social media (especially YouTube, Insta and Reddit). There's so much hate and intolerance to a point where I felt myself getting aggressive as well because you get sucked in, which shocked me (luckily I never meddle in these 'discussions', as far as you can call them that). This mostly happened while I was on my phone cause it's easy to read comments there and the scrolling is addictive. It's like a drug addiction, you know it's bad, yet you can't stop reading. To try prevent this I've taken a few steps:

Firstly I removed YouTube from my phone and am now watching only on my Playstation, you can't see comments on there. Although I don't really like this option, cause I watch a lot of YouTube in bed (my PS5 is in the living room), I couldn't think of anything else.

With Instagram I stopped following all 'news' pages where the most hate would take place, and am now only following friends, family and few select pages I know are fine (like cat memes and tattoo artist pages lol). For Reddit I unfollowed a lot of topics, and am now only joined with a handful that seem civilised enough.

I do notice this stuff works, at the same time feel a bit disappointed it's necessary to take these steps, cause sometimes through all the hate there is people that still make valid points or have interesting takes, it's just hard to filter and engage without getting death threats at the end of the day. I realise all this negativity affects my mind a lot during the day and I can feel myself getting more down and irritated in general.

Does anyone have any other tips that might work, or own experiences with comment sections that affected your mood/mental health? Sometimes sharing similar experiences helps..(I'll make an exception for these comments hehe)

I also found an article that's quite interesting explaining some of this stuff and how it can negatively impact you without realising. I'll link it down below for anyone interested.

nosurf,I deleted all my social media about 3 years ago and I hardcore regret it everyday. It literally pains me.,"I felt so cool and free for about 6 months but then the pandemic started and I realized how lonely I was months into that. Then it only got worse. Maybe if I had my friends to keep up with during those times I would have had it easier. I made a new insta and Twitter since but it’s just not the same. I’m not gonna add all these people I havent talked to in years or post pictures like I used to back in the day. And I hardly tweeted on my last account but it was nice seeing everyone else’s and being in the know.  

And with Facebook I never posted anhmore but I got invited to events and stuff and saw cool ones I would have never found elsewhere. Like I got to an art event and an owl watching event through Facebook I would have never seen otherwise. No idea If it’s still the same. And my mom is getting older now and I wish I had all the comments, posts, and photos to look back on and reminisce. Can’t do that now.  

What I’ve realized since going nosurf is that it was a huge mistake. People always said “if they’re your real friends they’ll talk to you offline.” And that’s bs. It’s perfectly okay to have causal online friends from school, childhood, work etc and only talk through social media and keep up that way. It’s not feasible to constantly be texting and phone calling Paula from 10th grade geometry, etc.  

It’s okay to have causal online friends who are not your besties. I only realized this after I lost it and won’t ever have it again. I lost so much deleting it all and it contributes to my daily depression quite a bit. And it simply isn’t fixable.

Since graduating, I’ve worked dead-end jobs, went to college for a semester &amp; dropped out due to failing grades by being on my phone in class instead.

About the last month or so, I’ve really wanted to limit or downright quit cold-turkey being on social media but here’s the problem; 

1.) most of my interests in life are rooted through the internet &amp; I am worried I’ll lose myself by ditching my interests.

2.) A lot of my friendships in life are connected through social media &amp; while I’m not worried about losing the friendships, I’m worried about becoming self-isolated and lonely.

3.) I’m worried by not being on social media, I will become uninformed and dumber by missing out on information. 

4.) I’m worried about losing my sense of self-image and losing my personality, sense of humor, quirky-ness, etc

If i would have it in my phone i would always carry the phone around which makes me bored of the music fast and make me open something different again, its weird.

On your PC for youtube with adblocker time used is reduced more, also with multiple tabs i scroll fast through everything and than stop for a few hours. On my phone i will ALWAYS open the next app after i closed one.

nosurf,"The lockdown experience during the pandemic transported many of us into a glimpse of the future, and it sucked","I've recently been thinking more about my experience of being locked inside my home, taking online classes, not having any social interaction other than through my phone or zoom, no physical reading material, food delivered to my house, doom scrolling my phone all day, staring at the TV, etc etc and the solutions to these scenarios were all purported to be digital. This is the future we were told, this is the solution we were told. Contact tracing through apps... Soon we will be required to own a smart phone so we can be tracked in such scenarios, and then I'll never be free of the smartphones grasp. 

Is this the future people really desire, or are we just floating on the digitalisation wave we have been sold as the solution to all life's problems? Why is it that digitalisation and technological change seemingly has no moral or psychological checks and balances like most other parts of life? People talk about far off concepts about sentient robots while disregarding the fact that people are becoming the non-sentient humans when our analogue world becomes more and more digitised. There are so many physical and psychosocial problems with modern day internet use that simply aren't being addressed. for something like a phone which has more or less become.an Extension of our bodies, we may as well treat it as such when talking about personal health measures.

nosurf,Worried about my husband - depression &amp; screen addiction,"We’ve (31f 33m) been together for 10 years, married 6 years with 3 young kids. His screen/addiction has been apparent throughout the relationship and has been an issue but one I let side as he’s always said “he could be out doing worse things” than being at home with the family. When we are home, we aren’t actually doing things as a family. 

He’s always worked full time, I’ve been a SAHM since our firstborn. We live a modest life and his work isn’t too strenuous. I do 99% of the housework and take care of the kids needs like school, play, cleanliness, most appointments etc. I’ve been working part-time at home, I set my own hours and work as I can in the day/week to get what I need to done while managing the kids (youngest isn’t in school as yet so we are out in the day at classes). 

The current season of work for my husband doesn’t require him to be out for meetings too often and he works from home taking calls, doing emails. As he wakes in the morning until about 1-2 a.m. he’s on a screen. When he wakes, goes to desk and does what work needs to be done then switches to a game. And will game until work comes in. It varies daily for the length of work. Then once he’s ‘off the clock’ he games. If I mention to him to get off the game especially while the kids are back from school to give them dad time, he will while on his phone either watching captured game play or scrolling social media/watching vids. It’s seldom he’ll actually take the kids out to play and it feels often when Ihave to ask him to do that like I’m torturing him. We don’t often get solo time as we don’t have much support near by (BIL recently moved back in with us as he’s in recovery. Currently not working, sleeps a lot of the day then games/watches shows. He does do some housework/ take the kids out to play in the evenings if it’s not too cold out and will babysit if he can).

I try to suggest alternatives we can do together, a big one is going for walks as it’s easy to just get outside in our neighbourhood. My work is on screens as well and I value the time I can go for walks or just disconnect and not be on them at home. When he brings up things we can do together, it’s often mentions of playing a game or watching a show and that’s difficult for me)

It’s become more worrying for me just as I try to envision our future as the kids get older because he doesn’t take care of his health at all. Doesn’t get any physical activity, not even brief walks daily..he doesn’t eat right at all. He has sleep apnea- this was diagnosed almost 3 years ago and he didn’t go through with getting a sleep mask. and is dragging his feet now to go to the dr now to get the mask so he’s not getting proper sleep at all. I feel that he really needs to talk to a therapist and get some help because whenever I’ve brought these concerns up to him, he gets defensive and deflective. My tone isn’t ‘right’ or if I write it out, I’m attacking. Says he will just have to go back to the office and work so we have that separation during the day — with both of us working at home it makes it seem to me that he’s not busting his ass daily. 

I appreciate the work that he does and I know what’s it’s taken him to get to this position but I also see just how present he’s not at home and how much game/screen play is happening. This has been an ongoing major issue for our family and I don’t want to be stuck in this rut. As we get older more complications will occur for him as he gets heavier and unhealthier. 

Could this be depression? I’ve tried talking to him about this all and he doesn’t seem concerned. I’ve asked him to cut down on game/screen use but no change.",2023-01-09 11:36:21,1673264181
nosurf,"Used internet to cope with shitty childhood, now I'm addicted","Grew up with my dad who was a drunk among other disorders he hasn't diagnosed. I had no mom, no siblings, no grandparents or cousins or any of that. 

I had no life as a child. Since I had no family and my dad was beer drunk everyday and he was hard liquor drunk on the weekend I never went anywhere. I have unironically lived my entire life on the internet. I'm 24 now, been online since i was 8. Obscure gaming forums, Facebook page meme communities, been around for Fred, Smosh, Shane Dawson, Nigahiga on Youtube, etc. Also been frying my brain with you know what since a little later than that age as well.  

I dropped out of a Comp Sci degree because I just couldn't keep up with the work load. Of course simultaneously dealing with my dad who has only changed for the worse since he's gotten older. 

While in the degree I would check my hours on Youtube and it would say 50 a week at some points. Combined with the 40 hours per 2 weeks on Steam... among other things too... If I had just shaved off like 25 hours on the nonsense I would have failed less classes and my life would have been way better than it is right now.

nosurf,How can I maintain friendships when I barely use social media?,"My concern comes from the “social norms” when it comes to social media.

I only have Insta, Facebook, and Snapchat, I only ever keep Snapchat on my phone incase someone needs to talk to me but I avoid stories, and Instagram and Facebook I just use on my browser like once a week and it’s cut my usage down 110%.

I just hate that these are the norms for social media Havers:

You must post a pic of your friend on your story if it’s their birthday and show them off to others or else they feel unpopular or not liked

You have to send memes all the time to let them know you think of them or to get a conversation started, and if you don’t get any then no one likes you, and you are expected to keep up with all trends and funny memes

You have to like and comment on friends selfies or else they think you don’t care

You have to send people constant Snapchat videos of your day in order to stay in touch or update them

You must tag each other in stuff all the time or else they think you don’t think of them, and if you don’t like or reply to their tag they feel dumb for tagging you

You must answer texts/messages right away or else you don’t care

You must post a bereal/Instagram/Snapchat story of exactly what you are doing, if it’s fun, to prove you have a life and are not boring, or else everyone assumes you are boring and do nothing with your life



Like HOW do I maintain friendships when I do literally almost none of these?

I can’t keep up.

I still text my friends and ask them about their lives and send them pictures of what I did on the weekend, I still say happy birthday and send them stuff over text I find funny or thoughtful, so why does it need to be normal to do all of the above!?

nosurf,Holding back a reddit addiction with a small fix,"I've been a pretty active user on reddit for years, and a lot of that I've spent addicted to it. You know how it works, close reddit after 2 hours of scrolling, get bored and open reddit automatically. I've tried to quit more times than I can count.

Over the many failed attempts at limiting myself I've got a sort of technique going that has got me down from about 4 hours of redditing a day down to browsing for about 1 hour. It's not perfect, and many of these are pretty basic things, but when you've tried everything and nothings working then try this...

The key is to put blocks in place to stop yourself mindlessly scrolling, but still allowing yourself on a little bit so you don't keep craving, *like an ex-smoker with a nicotine patch*. Here's what I do:

**Unsubscribe from everything but nosurf**
You open the app/website and you'll only see posts reminding you of your addiction so you close the site. This alone will work until you discover incognito mode or logging out.

**or Subscribe to non-addictive subs**
A bit of compromise to the above, subbing to things that don't really trigger that addicted part of your brain but still give you a little bit of what you crave. For me these are art subs or philosophy/mindfulness subs, you can find some in the sidebar. Again, works until you just logout.

**Use a 3rd party app that lets you remove the popular and all buttons**
^on ^mobile
I use apollo on IOS, it lets me delete the buttons for r/popular and r/all so I'm not tempted. The only crutch is the random subreddit button which I cant remove, I'd also recommend using the user/keyword/subreddit filter if your chosen app has that. This of course requires you to be logged in to not be redirected to popular.

**Use an addon to block the r/popular and r/all buttons**
^on ^PC
I use Adblock Plus on firefox, also I use the user script addon Greasemonkey to [force reddit into the old mode](https://old.reddit.com/r/userscripts/comments/8v0amu/autoredirect_good_ol_reddit_oldredditcom/) whether I'm logged in or not.
By forcing it to use old mode, you can block the r/all, r/popular, r/random buttons and also you can block the Next button at the end of a page. This of course means you get a bit of reddit whether you're logged in or not, but you only get 1 page at a time. It'll also help limit scrolling single subreddits too.

If you prefer userscripts, you can also block those buttons using a script. [Here's a ham fisted one to block all/popular/random](https://pastebin.com/raw/N2XtwDMG).

Make sure the addons above are also allowed to run in incognito mode.

So to reiterate, the idea is that you'll still need a bit of willpower to stop yourself finding a way onto the mindless browsing train, but compared to cold turkey this requires far less willpower since you're still getting a small 'fix'.

Hope it helps, if you have any of your own techniques along these lines let us know.",2023-01-09 00:51:49,1673225509

nosurf,how to use social media in a selective and healthier way?,"Hi everyone! I've been averaging 8 hours of screen time a day since I was 15, and really want to cut down on how much I'm using social media. I'm noticing physical effects of using my phone for so long (migraines, and pains in my hands and neck), and most of the time makes me miserable and stops me from focusing on my life.

I've tried getting rid of social media completely a couple of times, but always end up coming back as there are some communities I genuinely enjoy being a part of. I realised that I dont want to quit social media altogether and go full hermit mode, but that it doesn't need to be all-or-nothing either. I want to keep the few things that I enjoy, and discard all the rest. My main goal is to reach a point where I don't feel the need to use social media every single day of my life, and where I am being fully intentional when I do check in (most of them are small hobby communities, so limited and not huge time sinks).

Has anyone got any helpful advice on how they have achieved this? Would it be helpful to take a break for a while beforehand to reset myself, and how do I keep it going long-term??",2023-01-07 22:11:01,1673129461
nosurf,My attention span really suffered from surfing,"I've picked up reading an actual physical book again to start my no surf journey in the first quarter of 2023. 

After reading a few chapters, I realized that my attention span was really wrecked and influenced by the internet algorithm I've been exposed for so long.

Example is when I read a page (and this is a light read) my mind somehow wonders of to things like what my friends are doing -- urge to check fb/ig stories, should I open my phone, what if I google this etc, that I have to read the book page four times before the actual content sinks in.

The internet is built to keep your attention just going and going, pulling you in different directions of unrelated topics until you're sucked into rabbit holes of articles and fb stories and the like. I realize that I have to really re-wire my brain to focus on ONE thing which is the content of a book that is cumulative.

I’m totally addicted to the news about the war at Ukraine, and I tend to check again and again the headline’s, and then reading the news.

nosurf,"Rational ideas about how to make things better seem useless when in a craving based state, wanting to change how you feel","I've gotten somewhat better at wasting less time online.

With less of that pressure I can behave in a way that seems more rational.

When there is overwhelming pressure to do something to change how I feel, rational ideas about that become irrelevant. They become a kind of torture, because they make me feel worse about how I'm not applying them and changing my behaviour.

I don't think the craving to feel different is wrong. It is pointing out an important problem. Though, spending lots of time online isn't a good solution, and it even makes the problem worse in some ways.

""Makes the problem worse"" is another way of saying that it's addictive. The result is an even stronger craving to do something to change how I feel. But, temporarily stopping that never solved the problem, and plenty of the craving remained for other reasons.

Two things that may help are improved conditions which decrease the craving to feel different, and more useful ways of expressing that, which actually improve your life.",2023-01-07 07:54:58,1673078098

nosurf,It's starting to break my heart to see people on their phones,"As of late, I have been more aware of people on their phones, whether mindlessly scrolling or posing for pictures and it's starting to break my heart a little. I don't know how to explain it but what I feel is a mixture of pity, grief, and most importantly just sadness. The pity isn't even directed toward the people on their phones just at the situation itself. 

 When I am on the train people are either on their phones or sitting with their eyes closed after what seems like a long day and it just makes me incredibly alone and sad. I think what hits me the most is the superficiality of it all how right after putting on the biggest smile for their social media they seem so empty, and hollow. 

 I just think to myself 'there's so much more to life, this can't be it. please tell me this isn't all there is to it. I think what makes it hit harder is that there was a period of 2-3 months where I didn't have a phone or any real connection to the outside world and I felt so free... conversations had meaning again, the grass felt comforting, the slightest rustle of the wind seemed to reverberate through my whole soul. It seems like after living the richness of that life the hyper-connected one we're living now seems even more barren.",2023-01-07 01:03:47,1673053427

nosurf,"Does anyone feel like their Internet addiction has taken a lot away from quality ""leisure"" time or hobbies you still have interest on?","I've been lurking this sub for a while and love the community. I see that the issues most people bring up when discussing the negatives of their internet addiction are mainly productivity and self-care related, but has anyone stopped to think how their leisurely, completely ""unproductive"" but enriching  pastimes they had in the past were completely clouded by obscene social media consumption?

For instance, when I was in High School I loved film and cinema, I wanted to be a film director and obsessed with cinematic movements. Most people could argue that watching a movie is mostly a passive hobby, but for me it was incredibly stimulating, I felt completely engrossed in movies in a way no other media could do.

Then, I started binge watching Youtube videos and scrolling my life away on reddit. I still had a great interest in movies and filmmaking, I never stopped thinking about them, but I couldn't even muster the focus to sit through a movie.

&amp;#x200B;

I have deleted every social media from my phone, including Reddit and except Snapchat (I have a family group on it) but set a timer for 3 minutes on Snapchat because we don't share many messages on it. Set a short timer for apps that I use the most... And still I apparently look at my screen for 1h30min on average a day and unlock it more than 140 times. I do receive messages that I respond to but the app also let you see how many notifications you receive and 86 notifications (texts and mails) doesn't deserve unlocking my phone for 140 times a day and spending 1h30 on it imo. So I checked today to see what's up, and apparently I am spending time on apps I NEVER spend time on in general. I just traded social media and mindless googling for my calendar, constantly checking my mails and doing absoluetly nothing but staring at them or checking them for...no reason whatsoever? I think it's just a compulsion at this point. Like why the heck do I feel the need to unlock my screen that many time and how do I still spend 1 HOUR ON IT. It's mind-boggling to me how social media made me spent so many time on it I associated it with my smartphone use and need other non social media app to distract me.

nosurf,Big Tech Tricks for Keeping You Engaged: The Dark Design Patterns Used to Hack Your Brain,"Have you ever noticed that some apps and websites seem designed to keep you scrolling and clicking indefinitely? It's not just a coincidence - many tech companies use various tactics and ""dark design patterns"" to try and hack our brains and keep us using their products as much as possible.  

One example of this is infinite scrolling, where new content constantly loads as you scroll down the page, making it hard to ever reach the end. This can be found on many social media platforms and streaming services like Youtube and Netflix, which also use autoplay to keep you watching.  Another tactic used by tech companies is the recommendation algorithm, which suggests content to you based on what it thinks you'll like. This can be a great way to discover new things, but it can also lead to a ""rabbit hole"" effect where you end up mindlessly following one thing after another.  

And have you ever noticed that you get a little rush of excitement when you refresh your social media feed or pull to refresh on a streaming app? That's because these actions mimic the mechanics of a slot machine, creating a sense of anticipation and rewarding you with new content every once in a while.  

It's important to be aware of these tactics and how they can influence our behaviour. Our smartphones and other devices have the potential to be incredibly useful tools, but they can also be major distractions if we're not careful.

I've personally made it my mission to help people fight back against the patterns Big Tech is using to keep us addicted. I've started a company called [Unpluq](https://www.unpluq.com/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=icp-3-2dm-1ns-3), which has the goal to help everyone find a better balance in their device usage.

nosurf,Life before smartphones,"I just wanted to share a little about my experience growing up without a smartphone. I know it might be hard to believe, but there was a time when smartphones didn't exist, and people had to rely on other devices for communication and information.

I remember life before smartphones as being much simpler. I wasn't constantly checking my phone for notifications or scrolling through social media. Instead, I spent more time outside, playing sports or exploring my neighbourhood. I also spent a lot more time reading books, which I think helped me develop my critical thinking skills and imagination.

Of course, there were downsides to not having a smartphone. It was harder to stay in touch with friends and family, and I didn't have access to the same information and resources that I do now. But overall, I think I had a more balanced and fulfilling life without a smartphone.

I'm not saying that we should all go back to the days of flip phones and dial-up internet, but I do think it's worth considering the ways in which our reliance on smartphones has impacted our lives. There are definitely pros and cons to both sides, and it's up to each of us to find the right balance.

nosurf,Screen time making me anxious and depressed. But situation making it hard to quit.,"I have a debilitating chronic illness that has made me unable to work (I'm 26). I live at home and parents are emotionally absent, as they have always been. They are also very critical and unhappy with their lives so they put me down constantly. My mom has Asperger's and works multiple jobs. Dad had a stroke so doesn't work but can still take care of himself but has never been interested in talking to me or spending any time with the family. Brother is a severe computer game addict. I have no friends within 2000 miles of here. The feelings of loneliness and worthlessness really hard to deal with.

I think I am so chronically online to socialize (reddit and texting/messaging) and to escape my situation. When I feed bad, I go online, but going online for long periods of time just makes me feel 100x worse. And when I feel worse, I just go online even more. It's a downward spiral. And it's really ruining my health--both mental and physical. I have such crippling anxiety and depression now, that sometimes I find it hard to keep on with life. I mean, I might have depression and anxiety even if I didn't spend so much time on the internet, but it wouldn't be nearly as bad. I know this because when I spend a lot of time on the internet, my mental health becomes absolutely unbearable. It's also ruining my mind and memory.

nosurf,Reading is More Exhausting than I Realized,"A couple weeks ago, a friend on vacation lent me a book he highly recommended.  I haven’t read fiction on my own accord outside of manga and comics in probably 15 years, but it sounded interesting and it felt like a good excuse to get back into it.  He’s leaving next week and by yesterday I was only on chapter 5/12.  These chapters take about 2-5 hours to read, so I tried setting aside the day to finish it.  That time limit made me realize a few things.

First, when I tried reading right out of bed, I fell asleep pretty quickly again.  This was already after 7 hours of sleep and breakfast.  Happened at least 2 or 3 times before I stayed up for a considerable ammount of time.  In retrospect, it could have been some extra sugar/simple carbs I ate today, or the fact I was in comfortable sweatpants all day, but I’ve done the same with manga and had more focus.

The other lack of focus came from constant internet surfing.  Any time a thought came to my head, it would distract me from the book and I’d want to look it up.  I’ve been trying to wait until finishing a chapter, but then I go on 45-90 minute rabbit hole searches around the internet.  By the end of the day, I was only at chapter 9.  On one hand this is way more reading than I ever do and should be proud of that.  On the other, there was a lot of surfing that ultimately didn’t gain nearly as much as the satisfaction of getting further in the book.  Had there been no surfing, it’s possible I’d nearly be done with the book by now.",2023-01-05 16:56:53,1672937813
nosurf,How to delete once and for all TikTok,"**Introduction**

This might end up being quite long. Honestly, pretty much everything here could have been said about other social media but it especially applies to tik tok because it's insanely addictive.

**My experience**

I've used this app since 2017 - back then it wasn't even tik tok but musically. So I'm quite familiar with what kind of content you can find there. I really don't want to sound like a boomer here - I'm a teen myself -  these are just my own observations.

I hadn't log in for a while: I don't how much it had been but I guess around a month. It wasn't intentional, I just didn't feel the need to scroll. When I logged in again I was super confused on what was going on. I didn't know the latest trends and the new popular songs and topics. People even seemed to speak an entire new language because new words became popular. Every single video seemed to be so dumb and even if it contained some information it was explained in a such generic and distorted way. A thought passed through my mind: ""Is this really what people watch every day? How could I have watched this weird bullshit without even realizing it?"".

Basically, I couldn't see beyond my nose because my sight was obfuscated by scrolling. My brain became numb to the content I consumed without thinking.

**How it affects your attention span**

All of the above happened because my brain got used to the content I consumed. If you read books, read long answers and articles - activities that require some concentration - your ability to focus is high and you can easily assimilate complex information. If you watch various short videos your brain focuses on hundreds of different things and changes its focus very frequently. 

After that I stopped using it because I didn't feel the need to. Everything in there was so dumb and I just got bored of it.

**“Wherever there's bad, there's always good""**

Well, in my opinion there's actually some good content. For example it allowed me to discover new music and bands. It also got me interested in some topics like mbti types: however I didn't study this topic on tiktok but I browsed it myself and read long articles about it online. That's why I think you can't really learn anything on this app because it's made of short and messy videos; if you really want to then you have to get out of it and look up information yourself.

# Tips

To be able to quit you have to stop feeling the urge/need to use it. How to do so?

• *get a life*

If you had an entertaining life, why would you waste hours daily on tik tok? Maybe you're trying to escape from something.

• *make your feed boring*

Start liking dumb and boring videos. Soon the algorithm will send you more dumb videos and eventually you'll stop scrolling because you won't like your feed anymore and you'll get bored.

• *change your approach towards information* 

It doesn't necessary mean reading books, it could be also articles online, answers on reddit or quora, educational youtube videos. You could find a very interesting topic and read about it just out of curiosity.

• *replace tik tok with something else*

I think that if you are used to spend around 5 hours/day and all of a sudden delete the app it probably won't work. You'll feel a strong urge to reinstall it and eventually you will. So, my advice would be to reduce the time you spend on tik tok by replacing it with something else, more healthier, rather than just delete it.

• *keep in mind why do you want to stop using it*

Analyze what is exactly keeping you on that app. What kind of content do you desperately need? Maybe you just like aesthetic videos? Or you like the memes and sense of humor? Or it makes you feel like you fit in? Whatever it is, set some goals and have clear in mind why do you want to delete it.

These also are some results you might archive

\- you'll be able to focus

\- you'll become smarter

\- you'll become an interesting person with their own ideas

\- you'll develop your critical thinking

\- you'll enjoy your life without addiction and excessive amounts of dopamine

Keep in mind that it's not only about tik tok: the same applies to other addicting platforms. Maybe one step to improve your life is to clean up your digital life and stop escaping from the real one.

nosurf,I did some progress this week,"I struggle a lot with porn and social media was always a setback to me so after a lot of efforts I decided to use some an app to block their use entirely (even the web versions, even if I remove the app and download again) 

But I like the supportive communities on reddit and I follow a few recovery live coaches on YouTube, so I kept those two.

Now instead of several social media apps, I had two. But wasting the same amount of time. 

Them I used another app to help meeduce my time. I've set to 2 hours maximum per day for social. It's still a lot. But after that, it shutdown the app, not going back until next day.

But those 2 hours went like a blink.

So I found another app for lifestyle and habits and I gives me daily tasks. One of the tasks I set was ""no scrolling social media before noon"". 

I DID THAT. which gave me time to do other tasks.

At the end of the day I barely got anything done, but I still feel stressed and burnt out.

Well the reason is that none of the “breaks” I’m taking actually provide any stress relief. Most of the headlines in my news feed are something to be angry or anxious about. On social media, I stress over arguments with strangers in comment threads. I am basically just switching from one electronic feed, my work email feed, to another electronic feed, social media. Nothing I am doing actually provides any break from that constant electronic bombardment. It feels like I’ve have been working without a break all day long, yet I still haven’t gotten a full day’s worth of work done.

So I’ve been trying different things lately and it works. I just stare out a window, meditate, take a walk, close my eyes and listen to a song, whatever.

Don’t just find a different screen to stress over, take an actual break.",2023-01-05 14:27:47,1672928867
nosurf,No Surf Activity list,"There is a solid FAQ here on activities to do for no surf. I  wanted to add another resource I like a lot. It is from a guy known as Cam from Gamequitters. He has an online tool of stuff to do to stop playing video games. It works equally as well for no-surf.  Starting something new and developing new habits are a great way to break internet addiction.

nosurf,NoSurf/NoFap compatible solution for streaming music?,"I have restricted my Internet use at home strictly to office hours only (for WFH), using [this timer setup](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/xx655y/the_ultimate_nosurf_solution_by_using_timer/).

However, one thing that I kind of miss is the ability to listen to music during evenings and weekends. I do have quite a collection of physical CDs, and traditional radio exists, but the ability to stream music would be a nice plus. However, I don't want to compromise my NoSurf setup, because being offline feels amazing and liberating.

Has anyone of you resolved this? What kind of hardware/software setup would allow streaming music from specific streaming service(s), while at the same time making all other Internet usage impossible? Is there e.g. a dedicated hardware (jukebox?) for streaming music only?

An electrosmog-free solution without WiFi/Bluetooth is preferred, but I'm open for any suggestions.",2023-01-05 13:36:17,1672925777
nosurf,Any gamers here who wish they played MORE?,"I'm very passionate about gaming and have a healthy relationship with it, I tend to plan my routine around this hobby. But most of the time I end up not playing because I can't stop scrolling on printerest or I just have to read the next reddit post, or watch the next YouTube video. I get frustrated because I'm not spending my time doing what I actually love doing, but instead mindlessly consuiming media that will not cause an impact in any meaningful way.

I've decided to put an end to this and limit my online time. I'll download the pdfs I need to study for the week so I don't have the excuse to turn the wi-fi on. I'll write more on my physical journals, play the guitar, complete my sudoku book... and game! I'm only using my phone to talk to my friends and listen to podcasts from now on.

nosurf,The personal project that helped me overcome my mindless browsing problem,"For the past 5 years, I've been struggling with procrastination, wasting time on YouTube, Netflix, Reddit, TikTok, porn, and online games. I've tried various apps and extensions to help me reduce my procrastination, but none of them have the desired effect. I also tried a dopamine detox for a month, which was successful until it ended and I almost instantly relapsed back into my old habits. This is partly because there was no one to hold me accountable, especially since my work and personal life require me to be online most of the time.

At times, I felt like giving up on trying to fix this problem and accepting that this is just how I have to live. I even considered seeking professional help, but unfortunately, I don't have the budget for it.
However, I noticed that most site blockers take a ""cold turkey"" approach, meaning that you either use them or not at all. It's like telling smokers to stop smoking immediately even though they know it's bad for their health, which, generally almost would be impossible to quit that habit instantly.

I believe that we do have control over our actions when it comes to technology usage, we just often fail to set the right intentions in those moments. So, me being a product designer, decided to design a tool to help myself fixing this problem. After researching around the topic, I found out that the mindful approach works much better (20.58% to be specific) in reducing screen time and increase mindfulness on digital consumption.

The goal of this tool is to:
1). Help us regain control of our time with healthier technology habits. It helps us accept that we have a problem with controlling our screen time, without making us feel punished. It also checks in on our intentions at the moment of relapse and allows us to set limits on how much time we want to spend on a site. Plus, it continuously reminds us of how much time we have left, so we're not surprised when the time is up.

2). Increase productivity by reducing friction and helping us get into a flow state. Since this tool is meant to help us regain control of our time and dopamine, I decided to add a Pomodoro timer that we can start on focus sites, so we don't have to remember to start one ourselves. This makes it easier to get into a flow state and start working right away.

I have been using this tool on a daily basis and it makes me feel in control even when I am in mindless browsing mode. It made me realize that I did not want to spend my time on this site and that I just wanted to be distracted to avoid the pain of doing the things I need to get done.

I wanted to share this with others who might be struggling with the same problem. You can check it out at [intentio.work](https://intentio.work) and I hope it can help you as how it has helped me in making you more mindful and aware of your intentions.
Feel free to message me with any feedback or suggestions that you think could make the tool even better for you. Thank you for reading!",2023-01-05 12:57:27,1672923447
nosurf,I wanna become no surfer but I need the smartphone for exercises,"My main use of internet is from my smartphone

nosurf,How did we end up in this situation?,"The forces of capitalism drive companies to constantly innovate and improve their products in order to achieve growth. In a traditional business model, where consumers pay for products, this benefits both parties. Consumers have more choice and access to better products at lower prices, while companies are able to grow by offering high-quality products that people want to buy.

However, the rise of ""free"" products with ads has created a misalignment of goals between companies and consumers. The goal of these companies is no longer to provide meaningful content, but rather to create engagement and keep users scrolling in order to show them more ads. This has led to the emergence of the ""attention economy,"" where companies profit not by selling products, but by selling users' attention to advertisers.

Tristan Harris and others, such as those featured in the documentary The Social Dilemma, have pointed out that in this system, ""we're the product,"" and our attention is being sold to the highest bidder. It is important to consider the ways in which these economic systems and business models impact our relationships with technology and the content we consume. It is clear that these systems prioritize the interests of companies over the needs and well-being of individuals. As a result, it is up to each of us to take control of our own technology use and ensure that it serves our needs and goals, rather than the goals of the companies that profit from our attention.This is one of the reasons that led me to start [Unpluq](https://www.unpluq.com/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=icp-3-2&amp;utm_content=ns-2), a young startup with the aim to help everyone find a better balance in their device usage.

nosurf,At what point does it become abnormal to still be angry and hurt at something?,"


For context: I was harassed by a group online, including someone I considered a close friend and spoke to for over a year. I did not have hobbies, interests, real life friends and my family were abusive so I took the online bs to heart. I was harassed by these people for a long time, even when I removed myself from the situation I was told they’d still bring me up, I tried to argue my case but nothing got through to them and despite the horrible things they did to me they still view themselves as normal. Sometimes I’d only be in the same space as them for a day just to post memes and they’d start on me or be talking about me in a group voice chat and then start typing to bait me. I did have my problems but everyone in that group was weirder than me and they all did extreme things. The main reason I was even targeted in the first place was because I called them out for sexualising girls in their mid teens constantly, or because they’d act entitled to attractive women (they were all average or below looking themselves) meanwhile they’d accuse women of having high standards.

I left the group 5 months ago and from mid 2021 to mid 2022, I only interacted with them for a few hours to days and would be gone for months. I’m told they still bring me up and post pictures of me. I was targeted the most from mid 2021 to august 2022 I did have a few members obsess over me in late 2020 as well though.

Despite leaving the group, I still replay arguments in my head and get angry thinking about their projection, inconsistencies, hypocrisy, unfair targeting of me and extreme disproportionate actions towards me. I get genuine violent thoughts over this and have done for the past 8 months. I tell myself I shouldn’t care about deranged losers who lack self awareness (though I’ll admit I’m a loser too), I’ll tell myself that their reality is warped and remind myself of all the people who interacted with the group that branded them cringe worthy and insane. None of it makes a difference. I still want to confront specific members and I have violent thoughts and get extremely angry thinking about them. 

I’m saving up for therapy (which feels unfair considering they’re all deranged and need it themselves.) I just want to know if I’m insane for still caring.",2023-01-05 06:06:29,1672898789

going to start enjoying life and picking up new hobbies, since covid started in 2020 i’ve been glued to my phone and my brain feels like rot now. i used to be able to speak two different languages fluently, used to be able to play piano, used to play sports, and i used to be quite intelligent and very good at writing but now i find myself not being able to form sentences properly as you can probably tell now. i’ve forgotten so many words it’s embarrassing. 

i’m scared because technology and social media is a huge thing in this day and age and i fear i’ll feel alone and like i’m missing out, i’m scared that i’ll have no one to talk to, but honestly i need to learn how to be okay in my own company anyways. life doesn’t bring me joy anymore, i stay in bed scrolling and it drains me and i feel quite empty all the time. wish me luck!",2023-01-05 03:03:20,1672887800
nosurf,Reddit (sort of) relieves my anxiety and deep loneliness in a way other hobbies won't. not sure what to do about it.,"I have a few friends and we go to hikes and restaurants and whatnot on a weekly basis but when I am at home by myself, I feel this deep sense of loneliness and anxiety that reading other people's comments and posts in subreddits that I like kinda relieves it. It is as if I am surrounded by others in a community of people who talk about the same things I like. I don't even need to post or comment. just scrolling and reading is enough. I think the draw of reddit for me is the way it makes me feel less lonely. anything else even low effort activities like watching trash tv won't come close to reddit. Instagram and Facebook won't come close too. It's just reddit. It is the only medium that can relief my sense of loneliness and doom and gloom when I'm alone at home all by myself. I can spend hours scrolling /r/books reading people's takes on books, their approaches to reading, how they design their libraries and whatnot and feel like I am a part of a conversation with a group of like-minded people even though I am not.

   4. Notifications removed (it's same element as feed, I didn't figure out blocking one without another yet)
   5. You won't be able to view your or anyones publications, for the same reason as above

How to do it:

1. On mobile, get a browser which allows addon installation. I'm using Kiwi, but Firefox way is the easiest to accomplish, so I'll focus on that

nosurf,I'm So Tired of Wasting My Time on Social Media - Anyone Else Feel the Same?,"Hey everyone,

I just wanted to vent a little and see if anyone else can relate. I feel like I'm constantly wasting my time on social media. I'll get on for a few minutes to check something, and before I know it, I've spent hours scrolling through my feeds. It's so frustrating!

I know I'm not alone in this. I've heard so many people say that they feel like they're constantly wasting time on social media. And it's not just a feeling - research has shown that most of the time we spend on social media is actually wasted. It's not really making us any happier or more connected, and it's not even a good use of our time.

So what can we do about it? I've found that setting the default limits on my device usage and blocking distracting apps has helped me but, in the end, they are too easy to by-pass. I've also tried to be more mindful about why I'm getting on social media in the first place - am I just looking for a quick distraction, or do I actually have a specific reason for being there?

I know it's not easy to break free from the cycle of mindless scrolling, but I think it's worth it. We all have limited time on this earth, and I don't want to waste mine staring at a screen. If anyone has any other strategies or tips for reducing social media consumption, I'd love to hear them!",2023-01-04 14:09:09,1672841349

But if we look at similar events in the social media timeline — from the rise and fall of Friendster, MySpace, Google+, Tumblr, Vine and many others that walked the same path — the space and all those in it are probably just changing.

You can find a similar pattern with almost any tool or task. A search for ""colored pencil"" yields ""I tested EVERY colored pencil in the world!"" It's a short youtube trip from ""how do I drive screws into a brick wall"" to ""10 impact drivers compared"" which probably has 100x the views of an instructional video on using the tool. A video on minimalism has you shopping for a bunch of pure white Scandinavian furniture. Okay maybe that's an extreme example, but you get the idea.

And hey, shopping is fun, and many product review videos and articles are incredibly thorough and well done. So this is just a friendly reminder: the point of having stuff is to use the stuff. Next time you buy a piece of cookware or a paintbrush or guitar strings or whatever aspirational hobby item catches your eye, give yourself the satisfaction of spending some serious time using it.",2023-01-04 07:57:16,1672819036
nosurf,Gaming and Scrolling destroyed my life,"I was put on antidepressants at 13 and from that age until 18 I was severely addicted to video games. I legitimately played at least 10 hours a day, even on school days (which I barely went to) and eventually ended up dropping out my senior year because my grades were unsalvageable. On summers I probably left the house maybe 3 times over the course of 8 years, and on days I showed up to school I immediately went home and gamed. I abandoned all aspects of my life except gaming. 

At 18 I got burnt out on gaming and for the past 4 years I’ve done nothing but mindlessly scroll the internet, trying to chase that dopamine high I got from gaming. At 22 I’ve quit my SSRI cold Turkey about 5 months ago (huge mistake, never do that), and I’m just now realizing the extent of what I’ve done. The SSRI + excessive dopamine combo made me apathetic. I had zero aspirations or even emotions outside of video games and porn. 

I am constantly ruminating on the horror my parents had to go through of trying desperately to get me to go to school and failing. They have let me leech off them for the past 4 years and all I’ve done with the time is mindlessly scroll, not giving fuck about hurting them/costing money. I feel so overwhelming horrible and to top it off my brain is fried and I have zero social skills.  I went from being the one if not the most popular, good looking, and intelligent person in my class to being a 5/10 at best. I ruined my facial development by having nerd neck all throughout puberty and also developing gyno.  My vitamin d levels were also extremely low. If you guys saw my facial structure as a child compares to now it wouldn’t make sense. On top of all of that I can barely read a paragraph and remember anything from it, to say I’m scare brain is an understatement . I was reading at an 11th grade level in 3rd grade.  I guess that’s what happens when you mindlessly bounce around the internet 4 year straight, 12 hours plus everyday. 

I am making this post to encourage myself to quit all of this and start actuating some change in my life for once, and hopefully someone might leave some advice on how to heal my brain. I hope this is rock bottom
for me.",2023-01-04 05:14:34,1672809274

nosurf,Left social media since New Year and I’m feeling great,"I used to be over obsessed to social media.
I can say that I post like everything especially on Instagram just so my friends can see that I’m doing great in life because I always see them having good life, wealthy and successful and it frustrated me.

After a few years of doing that, I came to realisation that I should just stop. Stop everything. My friends won’t even care. They won’t look up on you except when they need help or have a question.

Finally, I decided to cut off myself from social media on new year and after 4 days in 2023, I felt a little better. My life seems to be better and I LOVE IT. I don’t have to share everything and just go on living my whole day.

I hope it could last forever though.

nosurf,A quick guide; critique; rant; technologies’ many flaws and how to overcome them.,"Going cold-turkey on computers and smartphones will not be possible unless you’ve reached your limit and can no longer tolerate it. In the same fashion as the last drop finally breaks the dam. You do have to work up to this point though by giving enough thought to how technology has finally lobotomized you, kicked you to the ground and spat on you after convincing you that it was just ‘a funny platform to meet new people and express your world views’. Well, 9 times out of 10 the people you have met on the internet have been crazy and your world views were shunned. You do have to commend the internet though, it keeps the crazies locked up in their basements, glued to their monitors and leaves the rest of us normal folk the outside world to enjoy with a little more sanity. But I digress.

	In my first week of digital-free life I had nothing to do all day… literally. I’d just sit there, on my sofa just thinking and wondering “What now?”. Well I overcame that challenge and here’s how:  
 

1. Boredom.  
 

	I will be paraphrasing, of course, but I remember reading “...Boredom is the anxiety of death for which only humans can experience, as we are the only species capable of understand our inevitable demise. Boredom creeps up slowly, makes us uncomfortable and forces us to move, to leave a mark in history, achieve something in our mortal lives which may become immortalized in others’…”. I’ve given a lot of thought to this statement and have come to the conclusion that being bored is okay in the same way having a blitz of pain or a sore muscle once in a while is completely normal too. You do not start shoveling Ibuprofen in your mouth every time you feel a blitz in the leg or a sore bicep, so why start devouring internet content every time you feel even the tiniest sense of boredom in your mind? In the end, learn to be bored, accept boredom for what it is – a motivator. Next time you feel boredom, instead of shunning away from it, fascinate over it the same way one may fascinate over a needle penetrating their skin to draw blood. Presence of boredom, much like pain, shows you that there’s still humanity in you left… and that’s the last thing you want to lose.

2. Work ethic.

	I struggled with work before I dropped my smartphone in a bin and replaced it with a Nokia. I’d sit and stare blindly at my monitor for a few seconds, before getting distracted by the pretty colors of the next meme I saw on the internet, procrastinating my work over many days until reaching the very deadline, then the nervousness would kick in and I’d finish my work. In the end, my phone wasn’t the problem, it was my work ethic. Working is much like operating a manual clutch in a car, at first it grinds and heats up and squeels before locking up shortly and finally delivering the full engine’s power to the gearbox, subsequently the driveshaft. Next time you have work to do, grind it out, heat up, squeel, the same way car’s clutch does, the same way a weightlifting athlete groans when lifting several times their body weight. After a while it will “catch on” and you won’t even notice being “in the zone” until someone disturbs you or your work is finished. If however, you’ve been at it for 3 hours and you still haven’t caught “the zone”, forget about it, go outside, enjoy your time with family, relax, then come back and start grinding it once more. It will catch on.

3. Entertainment &amp; false sense of accomplishment.

	Best part about being human is having the ability to accept events which are out of your control and working around them to satisfy your needs. The internet removes this life’s satisfaction, giving you the content you want, so to say spoon feeding it to you and also giving you the ability to control that content e.g. play/pause on Youtube; ability to change videos. This severely cuts down your attention span and makes you a mindless zombie consumed by the funny colors and noises. Well, I dropped Youtube as I’d spend listening to random bullshit for 8 hours a day without remembering a single word from those videos. Then I discovered the beauty of Television and Radio. You cannot rewind, fast-forward the movies you watch which forces your attention span to grow back to it’s former glory, same way with Radio. But be wary, whenever an advertisement comes up, turn the television or radio off, you do not have an immunity against propaganda, no one does. Use those 5 minutes let your eyes rest, think over what you just watched and what of value you learned.

	False sense of accomplishment was supposed to be a separate bullet-point but I decided to merge it with entertainment since they are connected. Stop playing video-games, they’re a waste of times and provide no usefulness or satisfaction for you, especially the way gaming industry is nowadays. Your save-files and hard-earned items in an R.P.G.M.M.O. are just electricity in some remote server conglomerate that can disappear at any time. Instead of grinding a character for six hours, how about you start grinding you I.R.L. character by exercising for six hours.

4. Friends.

	You most likely will not find or don’t have friends that have this “nosurf” view on life but you can still hang out with them, whenever you think about your friends, think about the views you share, not the views you oppose. One of my friends shares an opposite political view of the world from me but what joins us together is the shenanigans we both endure in. Other than that, if you do not have friends, go now and find some. Join a club, go out in the street, to the pub and start talking to people, social anxiety is not an excuse; you do not want you deathbed surrounded by nobody.

5. Social media.

	I’d compare social media to a “free candy” van parked outside of a kindergarten. It lures oblivious folks in and then strips them off innocence and last remaining bit of humanity. Having the ability to contact everyone and anyone at any time while seeing what others are doing, subsequently sharing ours is a luxury that would sound like science fiction to a person born one-hundred years ago. As the saying goes - “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”

But, much like magic, there is devil-play involved and the devil-play in this context is your privacy and mental health. In the olden days, whenever someone had an opinion, they’d share it with the person nearest to their reach, but nowadays, sharing an opinion, is like being on a pedestal in front of a crowd of people. One wrong word and you’re disowned by strangers and friends alike. Imagine if whenever you had something to say, you’d have to stand up in front of a crowd of people and say it loud and clear. This way of speaking, even rational ideas and thoughts can be turned into crazed ramblings by someone’s untrained ear. Next time you have an opinion to share, keep it in, if it’s important, you’ll remember by the time you meet up with your friends. If it’s not important, you’ll forget it by the time you meet up with your friends and in turn you’ll save yourself the embarrassment.

6. General notes.

	This is a miscellaneous section of view-points that have helped me overcome my digital addiction and just have helped me in my day-to-day life, I do caution you, these may not entirely fit your world-views, so understand that both of us come from different places of the world with different norms and know that fighting will be pointless because in the end I won’t change my opinion, you won’t change yours.  

	Take on a stoic view of material things. Soda is no longer Soda, but funny colored sparkly death water. Smartphone is no longer a smartphone but a square plate of glass and copper that shows colors and sometimes screams. You car is just block of steel that sometimes doesn’t want to move and sometimes moves you, et cetera. This view of materialistic things devalues them and makes you less stressed about “getting the new car, getting the new phone, getting the new fashionable dress.”

	For beer there is water, for cigarettes there is air, for computers there are books, for hamburgers there is bread, for video-games there are friends.

	We live in a world where food, clean water and shelter are so easily accessible to most people. Frankly, we live in a Utopia. But humans are as humans do and when all of their problems have been solved, they create new ones to solve just because. Don’t do that, enjoy life.

	Stop whining about meaningless stuff, it always could be worse. For example: if the coffee you ordered came cold, remember that you could always end up having to drink murky water from a puddle in a diseased field. Instead of complaining about that geeky sweater you received as a gift from someone, remember that you could always end up shirtless in the streets in the dead of winter. This thinking process puts great deal of appreciate in your common day-to-day life.

Fight club: “Working Jobs We Hate So We Can Buy Shit We Don't Need”; “Things you own end up owning you.”; “Anxiety, and desire. That's how they sell.” (note: I have not watched the fight club, if these quotes are wrong, tell me.)

Closing statement:

	I do apologize for going off-track in the end, but it needed to be said. Social media, smartphones and just in general this quick-fix way of living has made everyone unhappy and craving more for stuff they do not need. I wrote this in hopes of sharing my “nosurf” view to others and, in turn, I hope I have helped at least one person get away from this diseased pit that is the internet and it’s many traps.

	Best way to stop an addiction is not to start in the first place. You won’t need to drop alcohol if you never tried it, you won’t need to drop tobacco if you never tried it, you won’t need to drop drugs if you never tried it, you won’t need to drop social media if you never tried it, et cetera.

	If you notice any grammatical or syntax errors in my thesis, please write to me. English is not my first language and any chance of improvement would be super.

	I hope we can further discuss this in the comments. In a civilized manner.",2023-01-03 23:50:15,1672789815

nosurf,Screens help extend the days of northern winters,"Had the day off today and realized something. I have no problem having my screens turned off as long as it's bright and sunny outside. I get things done, I clean the house, I go for walks, I go for long drives, I play instruments, I see people, etc.

But, I live in a northern country, and now as the sun is setting at 3 pm, far far to early to go to bed, it feels really depressing without the screens on. It's like I have to use screens to artificially extend the day to it's full length, otherwise it would feel like I'm getting ready for bed at 3 pm already. And that thought is really depressing.

Maybe some people are good with letting the darkness put them in a mellow mood and everything, but at 3 pm that's just too god damned early for me. There are technically so many hours left of the day and I'm not ready to have my energy sapped like that. The screens renew my energy and fools my brain that it's still daytime, but the difference is that everything I do then is on a screen.

No wonder why I can't cut any more screen time out of my life when living in a norther country, where half of the day basically sucks without them.

There's not much controversy.

But my relationship with Youtube is more complex: I already felt extremely comfortable there, with videos that were super fun, profound, spiritual, didactic, that helped me a lot. Sometimes I put on a video, and I go to work and it helps me a lot to concentrate, as if it were a podcast.

But sometimes, I get into a cycle of videos on Youtube that add nothing to my life, but just make me procrastinate a lot, are triggers to access other sites or are just useless and really bad. And with the shorts and stories, it only got worse: THEY PUT A TIKTOK ON YOUTUBE!!!

Any tips? How do you manage Youtube? Better stop altogether?

I've been doing something for a long time that has helped me to use YouTube more balancedly: turn off notifications. I'm addicted to comments on the Internet, whether reading or commenting.

nosurf,Do we need tools to help balance our screen time?,"Hey Nosurfers,

I'm Tim, one of the founders of [Unpluq](https://www.unpluq.com/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=r-post1&amp;utm_id=reddit). Unpluq is an app that helps you use fewer apps. It might seem paradoxical. People also told us that, we got comments from people saying things like:

""Do I really need this? I can just turn off my phone""

""If you want to reduce your screen time, just stop using social media apps""

""Do you really need an app to solve this, just put your phone away""

While these statements might be true for some people as ways to reduce screen time and balance technology use, there are a couple of problems. If it's really that easy to reduce phone usage without external help, why is almost everyone's screen time so high, and why do 82% (according to data from 600 US smartphone users) of people say they want to reduce it?

Firstly, it’s hard for people to admit that they have a problem, and especially that they need help to solve it. 

But we shouldn’t feel ashamed of that at all. 

Distracting apps are designed to be addictive, manipulating users without their knowledge and keeping them hooked with infinite scrolling. Apps use deeply rooted psychological tricks to keep you glued to your screen. Our human brains have a hard time winning the fight from the mighty algorithms. 

Research shows that willpower works like a muscle, which gets fatigued over time. If we apply this analogy to Unpluq, then Unpluq can be seen as a tool that reduces the amount of ""heavy lifting"" the user has to do themselves by supporting healthy digital habits. Tools like Unpluq help users make the right decisions and regain control of their valuable time and attention, enabling them to use it with intention.

Of course, there are other ways to solve this problem. You could learn to control your own behavior and improve their self-control through workshops or coaching. So if you’re looking for a simple solution that gives you a push in the right direction, [Unpluq](https://www.unpluq.com/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=r-post1&amp;utm_id=reddit) is here to help.

I’m curious to hear what you think about this?

nosurf,Psychological work AND material changes - not mutually exclusive,"I have seen a number of posts here saying things like ""ditching your smartphone won't solve your problem"" or locking it, etc. And that the real issue is psychological and you must work on that. I agree with the psychological work, but not any advice that looks down on making changes to your internet accessibility as a ""bandaid"" fix; sometimes bandaids help.

I just want to point out with internet addiction, like any addiction or disordered relationship with stuff, material changes can be a critical part of recovery in conjunction with psychological work. You should not feel ashamed for changing your device or internet service etc., especially when starting. It will likely make a difference. I recently switched to a unihertz atom and cut down my time wasted surfing drastically. I have deep work to do, both in meditation and therapy to address my mental inclination for escapism, be it internet or in the far past substance abuse.

Change takes time and work. Smartphone apps have largely been developed to be addictive; you are not weak for lacking self control to have a smartphone for some time, breaking a cycle of behavior can be majorly helped by changing your environment to be less tempting. 

For some people, changing their internet accessibility without therapy might also be enough to shift their relationship with the internet and reprogram their mindset.

nosurf,I'm ditching the Apple ecosystem to get my life back again,"A couple of years ago I bought in heavily to the Apple ecosystem—iPhone, Apple Watch, Macbook—thinking that they would improve my career prospects, social life etc.   


In short I bought into the marketing, and at the time ClubHouse (lol) was Apple exclusive. The problem when it comes to NoSurf?  


It's **impossible to get the same amount of blocking customisation with Apple as you can with Android**. Previously I had a great setup from a couple of apps which blocked *all* internet access at certain hours so I could concentrate on reading, writing—in short, the things that for me make life worth living. I also blocked money-wasters like Uber Eats or online games like OSRS.  


Not only did I dump all of that a couple of years ago falsely thinking I needed to be 100% committed to a strong social media presence for career and social advancement, but recently when I've come back down to earth I tried installing the same on my iPhone, and simply put it's piss-easy to remove, uninstall or otherwise disable these Apple-native blockers rendering them useless.  


I've just sold my Apple Watch and iPhone on the second-hand market, and have gone back to my old Pixel 2. Keeping my MacBook, since Cold Turkey works very well on it, but am not at all committed to this OS if things change (which knowing Apple they very well might).

nosurf,I finally did it,"So today, as part of my New Year resolutions, I deleted all social media apps from my phone. From now on the only way I can use any social media is via a computer in my room, where I am planning to install blockers for the most distracting sites (YouTube and Twitter for me personally). 

Maybe to you it doesn't sound like a big step, but in the last couple of months I've realised that I've been using social media excessively and not being mindful of the way I spend my time, which resulted in my attention span getting really bad, as well as messing up my sleep schedule. I don't want to quit social media completely, because I think it can be nice in moderation, but I hope that by making it less accessible I can break the habit of mindless browsing.",2023-01-02 14:28:40,1672669720

nosurf,Switch Back to an Alarm Clock,"I've finally been getting serious about curtailing my social media use.  Reddit is a particularly entrenched habit of mine.  For years I've made half hearted attempts to cut back but nothing stuck.

For anyone in a similar position, I'm happy to report great success from switching back to a regular alarm clock and charging my phone in my kitchen.  This has completely eliminated browsing in bed before going to sleep and browsing immediately after waking up, before even brushing my teeth.  These categories of browsing are particularly ""unhygenic"" in my experience and after several months of this, I can't imagine having my phone next to me in bed.  A few times, I've lapsed and brought the phone in bed to browse, but it feels gross.  


To anyone struggling, I found this step yielded concrete results in a specific area.  Vague goals of ""cutting back,"" in general depended entirely on my self control and led to lots of guilt spiraling.  Switching to an alarm clock and banishing the phone from bedtime was a concrete category of browsing that was easier to eliminate.

Has anyone else tried this?",2023-01-02 00:51:49,1672620709
nosurf,"There is no light at the end of the tunnel for me, its either a mental asylum or suicide","A while ago I posted a warning from severe internet addict. TLDR: I have been addicted to the internet since around 10-12 years old and spent pretty much 8-12 hours per day alone online just zoning out, playing games and watching movies/streams/anime. Internet completely replaced the real world and it was my reality ever since. Had no concrete experiences that would build my character/personality, no friends, no girlfriend or a job and I barely made it through school. Internet replaced all of that and filled all my emotional needs.

This is an update from that post. I'm currently 3 weeks free of the internet and my brain is slowly reintegrating into the real world. I've joined the gym and started reading books while also got an appointment with a psychologist. This reintegration process is extremely painful and it makes me feel like I will most likely go insane since reality is too much for me to bear. It feels like my brain is finally waking up from a deep slumber that lasted for 10 years which feels somewhat nice, but then the realizations hit me. 

I realized that my development pretty much stopped at 12 years old when I developed this addiction, I realized that I'm completely socially inept and I don't know the very basics of human interaction, I realized that everyone will from now on treat me as a 22 year old while in reality I have the experiences of a 10 year old kid, when I'm walking around outside and seeing kids from collage/high school hanging out it hits me how much I missed out on and how lonely I truly am, I realized that I can't and probably never will be able to connect with people since I basically missed 10 years of social development, I realized that I'm a total and complete social reject and a failure in all life aspects, I realized that reality that I built for the past 10 years is nothing more than a giant illusion that has no connection with the real world. When this illusion that I built my identity on and is keeping me sane shatters I will most likely end up in a mental health ward. And don't get me started that my concentration is completely shot and my once sharp brain has turned into a complete mush with the damage probably being permanent. 

I strongly relate to the user /u/Brigand92g who had a similar addiction to the internet. When he quit and tried reintegrating into society he went insane which can be seen in his latest post. I feel like I'm going to end up in  a similar way. 

Overall it feels like we will treat internet similar to cigarettes. Nobody payed attention and doctors even said smoking is healthy back then, but now we realize how big of a deal it actually is. Once science takes this seriously and dives into it properly people will be shocked on how much this thing is changing the brain. There is a reason why the Chinese government limits how much time per day people can spend online. They realize the damage its doing to young kids and severe internet addicts.

This post is pretty much a giant ramble and cope since I have nobody to talk to that truly understands how damaging the internet can be. I'm scared of what is to come when I continue on this detox journey. These 3 weeks have been horryfing already and have been ridden with severe anxiety and mental breakdowns. Please if you have kids force them to be in real life as much as possible and be a good parent and stop the addiction in its tracks. Nobody noticed",2023-01-01 20:03:09,1672603389

nosurf,Success,"I just want to share a success-story, even if it doesn't fit in with most of the nosurf content (I think)

I've been struggling with escapism for many years, resulting in panic attacks when I didn't have any content to watch (mostly tv series). I wouldn't necessarily binge, but I would watch anything remotely interesting to fill the void and spent hours planning my viewing behaviour and looking for news on new content.

This escalated more and more, every year I would watch more, have less days when I wouldn't watch anything and get more anxious. I was very aware of this being an unhealthy coping mechanism but I didn't know how to stop. I googled and googled but I didn't fit the criteria for addiction and it made me feel super lonely and alien and weird.

One day this summer I stumbled upon Internet and Tech Addicts Anonymous which is 12 step program. I was super vary, it did sound a bit cult-like. But I needed support, needed to feel reassured that I wasn't overreacting and just feel heard. And they did hear me, and continue to hold space. (without being cult-y, lol)

I managed to change my viewing behaviour and only watch shows I really am interested in and care about. I also limit my news intake on entertainment related stuff. It's not a miracle cure, but I'm consuming way less than in the last 5 years.

I still track my consumption. In the last 5-ish years, the amount of episodes I watched was going higher every year. This year it was less. I went from 402 episodes a year (about 270 hours) to 293 episodes (about 195 hours). 

I understand that people who see this number could think that this isn't much, it doesn't sound like an addiction and I'm making a fuss. The important thing here is that I was suffering and I wanted to stop and I couldn't. It's not important weither or not I was pressuring myself ""for no reason"", I just wasn't happy with it. And I was able to change it, and I'm feeling way better about it. Please be kind.

nosurf,Doing a social media detox for the month for January. Who's interested in joining?,"I've now been doing a detox for each month since October and I'm liking the way I feel during each one.

In my previous [December detox post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/z9ccm1/will_be_doing_a_social_media_detox_for_the_month/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), there were comments asking what the rules are, how we will hold ourselves accountable, what we will do with our time or what to do when feeling the trigger to give in, and I realized I hadn't actually thought to make a plan with those in mind. 

I don't know how to make rules for other people to follow and I feel like I'm only using 3% of my brain these days so my list will be incomplete but here are my own:

&amp;#x200B;

**The Rules:**

Use only the social medias that have a necessary function such as for work/business or are useful and the least addictive and turn off notifications for the rest.

Entertainment like TV shows, movies and anime can be allowed but restraint must be practiced to avoid binging on them

Avoid deleting apps or using blockers to be able to sit with the urge/impulse of logging in and understand what the psychological source of it is, and to practice letting the urge/impulse to pass on its own without giving in to it. (I never used blockers anyway).

Unless the computer/laptop or phone must be used for work, keep screen time to a minimum and do not mindlessly wander around the web looking for something else to replace social media.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**What to do with spare time:**

&amp;#x200B;

Allow boredom to be felt and change it into a practice of stillness and self-reflection.

Do the things that have been neglected to get done from squandering time on social media.

Structure each day with something to do with your friends, family or just yourself.

Pick up activities that require effort and have a slow reward such as reading books to wean off of the surfium (surfing + opium = surfium). 

Practice meditation to help the frontal lobes strengthen executive function

Go outside whenever the weather permits if in cold climate.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Staying accountable (**I don't really know how to answer this one)**:** 

**???**

&amp;#x200B;

**What to do when feeling triggered/tempted:**",2023-01-01 00:04:52,1672531492

nosurf,"Facebook Privacy and Past, Need Help Please","Hello, I know there are other facebook removal posts but I was unable to find one that answered my questions so please excuse me. I've had my facebook for the past 10 or so years since I was probably 10 years old or so (big mistakes)... During my middle school days I would send messages in the group chats or to friends that were extremely personal, edgy, embarrassing, etc. I would just post without thinking very much into it since I was very young. 

I am now looking into trying to delete all these messages that I have sent and while trying it out, there does not seem to be a delete button but instead a ""remove for everyone"" and ""remove for you"" option. I plan to use the ""remove for everyone"" button and manually delete these messages since for my personal sake I want peace of mind they are gone. I do plan to delete my facebook account afterwards but again, for peace of mind, I want to manually delete all the weird messages and stuff I have sent to people before deleting my facebook. I do not mind doing this because it's not a ton of messages.

Unfortunately, I can delete messages between current friends but if the conversation is with a deleted account (It would say Facebook User) or I have been removed/left the group chat I am not able to unsend these messages.

My questions are:

1. Does anyone know if this is the best method if I want to get rid of past conversations? Deleting manually with ""remove for everyone"" (for peace of mind that it's deleted) and then afterwards deleting my facebook?
2. Does ""remove for everyone"" work or is there another way to delete messages that's more guaranteed that it's gone?
3. What can I do about messages I have sent to people that have deleted their facebook and group chats I am no longer in? It just gives me anxiety that people can still see the message because again there was lots of ""personal stuff.""

Without the internet (other peoples opinions) we would only get fed whatever the mainstream news wants to feed us... and half the time it's completely BS, let's be honest. 

I think it's pretty clear by now that most of what we hear from the mainstream news is absolute brainwashing garbage. However sometimes we can get away with listening to the mainstream because we can then go on the internet and listen to other peoples opinion on something and it can open up a whole new world of thought, opinion and debate, which is good.. 

So, with that said, my FEAR is that if we ditched our smart phones and stopped using the internet, we would start believing whatever it is they want us to believe, which is not good.

nosurf,Life happens outside the internet.,"Hey guys.

First of all, I am sorry if i write something wrong, because English is not my first language.

I’d like to tell my history here a little bit.

In 2019, after breaking up with a girlfriend that was really important to me, i found out about no surf and decided to put this in practice in my life in 2020. But as we’ve had the pandemic, i lost my job and everything was online during that times, what made me get back to being online all the time and after that, i never tried to stop again.

But now, in the last months of 2022, i was meeting a girl and unfortunately our relationship didn’t work out, but something interesting happened.

Since our schedules were divergent, we could only see each other late at night, after 10 P.M, and one day, after i took her home, i was getting back to my house, walking on the street alone, way after midnight and i suddenly felt something different.

My conscious was different, my mind seemed to be opened and i was feeling alive in a way that i haven’t felt in years. As i was walking, i looked at the bars where there were lots of people chatting, eating, drinking, having fun, i listened to the music that was playing and i’ve had the sensation like i dove in a pool when i was 15 years old and had just got out now at 30 and everything was light and clear.

Then, i’ve had an insight that almost all the good things i’ve experienced in life was outside the internet. The best times of my life happened before internet was widespread.

I remember between 2004 and 2006, when i was between 12 and 14, we didn’t have broadband connection easily available here in Brazil, only dial-up, and since we couldn't be on the internet all the time, we used to skateboard while listening to music in a skate park, we played soccer, we went to teenage parties and lots of other things. Of Course we used internet, orkut, Msn messenger, but it was just a support for our real life and not a replacement for that.

After i was 15 and broadband internet started to get affordable for the average citizen, everything stopped,  all the friends disappeared and everyone, including me, was stuck inside their homes and years later with the smartphones, things got even worse.

So i was thinking about my life and really, the few good experiences i’ve had after i was 15 happened outside the internet too.

In 2011, the soccer team i root for had won the brazilian cup, the girlfriends i’ve had, a small trip i took in 2015. All this moments happened out of the internet, in real life.

All these years, for staying at home on the internet, surrounded and overwhelmed by contents, like movies, series, sites, podcasts, i noticed i didn’t do the things i wanted to do.

So i decided that now in 2023 i will only use internet for surfing during two hours on saturdays. Outside of that, it will be used only as a tool for banking, maps, uber and this kind of things.

This way i expect to force myself to find other things to do in life, get out of my house more frequently and have other good experiences.

And after telling my history, i’d like to propose an exercise, whether you comment here or not, i want you to think about the good things that happened in your life and ask you, were they in or out of the internet??

I bet the majority of it happened in the real world, outside this prison called internet.",2022-12-31 06:21:41,1672467701

I woke up very early this morning. My son has flu and wanted to sleep with us and I got a karate kick in my belly during sleep and woke up. Little guy made it clear. I went to the sofa in the living room, made some coffee and decided to watch some YouTube on the tv. I don’t have ads due to the fact I still have a dumb TV and connected my laptop. I started binge watching. In about half an hour I got bored. Switch on the tv and see the news. I have my fb account which I visit every ten days. Same shit there. Damn! Have I reached the mountain top of utter bullshit ? I switched it off and continued watching tv. Now I am writing this post through my iPhone and after that I will delete it. We reached a peak where the whole internet is owned by 2-3 corporations. Our data is sold to them and no one holds them accountable. If you download an illegal mo3/movie or something else then justice comes after you. 
You go out in a bar and no one watches or talks. Even my generation. They have the phone in one hand writing messages and keep eye contact with their friends who does the same thing. Damn. I went to a pretty hip place which I liked with two colleagues. We were the only ones talking, having a laugh discussing things from our workplace. I didn’t understand how time passed and how many drinks I had. I had a very good time and returned home. Like us was some other tables with various ages. Older, younger generations talking like us. So it’s not a generation thing. Is how we have lost contact with the real world outside. Whatever you do, change your smart to a dumb phone, cancel your internet subscription etc won’t give you the solution. You have to self discipline yourself first.

nosurf,Stop overvaluing random opinions you see online.,"When I was a heavy Reddit user, I would take comments personally. Most of you wouldn't admit it, but you probably do this too. Don't worry. It's just another issue that stems from being chronically online. When you spend more time on Reddit than you do in real life Reddit becomes your reality, so of course, you're gonna take things more seriously than you should.

Here's a technique that you may find helpful. The next time someone leaves a comment you find irritating/offensive/upsetting go look at their post history. Take a glance at the communities this person decides to spend their time in. You can sort of get an idea of who you're dealing with.

This website has a serious problem with overvaluing random opinions. Chances are the last argument you got into on Reddit was with a 15-year-old masquerading as an adult. Ah yes, user XYZ spends most of their time posting furry porn and anime. They're surely an expert on this incredibly complex topic I'm arguing with them over.

nosurf,How to curb internet use when your job depends on it (special case),"Quick rundown: I’ve been addicted to the internet for a long time. It got worse after a series of events in my teenage years to young adulthood and I used it as a coping mechanism. Combo of PTSD and undiagnosed ADHD made me super susceptible to it. I never had a problem with it until certain life events got out of hand. I literally escape and lose track of time whenever I’m in a surfing hole.

And this might be really strange to say but I’m “good” at the internet, even though I love the outdoors and being physically in tune with my environment. It’s almost like a split personality. 

I met almost all of my IRL friends through the internet and social networks, starting from oekaki boards (Japanese flash sites with drawing software) and tumblr, to discord and Twitter…I learned how to draw really well and discovered my career path + passions in college through these communities.

I currently work in the most niche / esteemed institution for the career I’m pursuing in part because of a reference I got from a friend on discord, and…I also work for what is the most popular slang dictionary on the internet (which was also offered to me through a friend on discord). It’s often crazy to think about. Ridiculous, even.

Obviously all of this makes it REALLY hard to curb my internet addiction, especially the latter position because my job entails curation work. I literally cull this dictionary and find the best words to archive. Part of me wants to learn how to fucking code to make a script so it can do the work for me! It’s a huge time suck even though I love what the dictionary represents and how it serves the world. Im currently learning html + css and I eventually want to move onto more grand skills, like machine learning.

I would love some advice about my unique situation. Over the years I’ve done a lot of therapy and I’m on meds, plus I am very physically active and go to the gym a lot. I eat a healthy diet and I’m connected to a large community of friends in a big city. I have a good foundation. I’m proud of the work I’ve done but feel like I’m keeping a big secret. It’s the shame that is getting to me.

I am hoping for resources that serve other people with jobs like mine. I have tried time restriction apps but they’ve never worked for me. Idk if this is possible but I would love some type of support buddy through this, so I have someone to openly share my journey with so I don’t feel alone. If anyone wants to DM me, I’m open to it!",2022-12-30 21:06:11,1672434371
nosurf,social media blockers?,"I've been perusing old posts and the links and resources provided, but not coming up with what I need. I am looking for something with a timer, so that I can't access social media during certain hours of the day, but can other times (when it's appropriate). Also, I think I'd rather pay for an app because I understand that ""if it's free, you are the product"". I am needing it for Chrome on a laptop.

nosurf,I think I need to stop working from home. Has the shift to remote work affected anyone else?,"The shift to remote work over the last 2-3 years has provided many positives. I can clean the house more often, easily cook dinner for my wife and I, have more time for the gym, and save money on needing a car for a commute, just to name a few.

However, in terms of distraction, working from home has been the worst thing. I was diagnosed by a doctor with ADD (before it became an outdated term and replaced with ADHD) and have been struggling with it for many years.

Having that lack of separation between home and work has become more of a problem as time has passed since COVID. I find it difficult to focus on my work when the TV/PC/porn/video games/etc. are right there. I find that the second I don't want to do work, I find myself clicking away to Youtube or heading to the couch to watch TV.

I also find myself laying in bed far longer than I should because I can and I rarely go outside during the weekdays. I'm not sure remote work for my is healthy.

If I can find an on-site position that is close to home and hybrid (1-2 days at home), I think I will take it. It will create inconveniences that I will have to adjust to, but I think the routine is something I need.

Has remote work affected anyone else in a similar way? Were you able to overcome the struggle or did you also go back to working in an office?",2022-12-30 14:03:30,1672409010

nosurf,PC breakdown that's a blessing in disguise.,"So recently my PC has chosen to die on me. I tried everything to fix it most likely a motherboard and graphics card malfunction so I salvaged parts that i know ARE working still for either selling or reuse for a new build in future which I doubt.

I've always wanted to downgrade my tech but I didn't want to waste my PC and after having it 5 to 6 years its fatal day has come. Its a blessing in disguise really as its given me a reason to finally get rid of the most addictive piece of tech I have and regain some self control.

Right now I use my phone and a crappy laptop cheap third party make to do the usual Google and YouTube video surfing n bit of Netflix.

However I have notice my time has been cut down already. I am getting tired easier during the day.

I'm thinking on selling my monitors soon as i no longer have a need for them. I've donated the tower case to a charity shop. 

I'm excited and nervous of my new tech life I never realised the privilege it was to have a PC or any computer till now. Which makes me more grateful for just having a mini laptop n phone.

I have a steam deck which let's me play games if I really need to. So I probably won't even bother building a new PC in the end especially if I ha e no urge for virtual reality.

Till next blog have a nice day and happy new year.",2022-12-30 05:43:35,1672379015
nosurf,2022 Nosurf success!,"Throwaway because I don't have a real reddit account (obviously lol).

Thought I'd make a post about my successful experience with nosurf in 2022. There are a lot of negative and hopeless-sounding posts here so I want to do my small part to show that success is possible. I'm defining success for me as no longer having any real urge to browse reddit or twitter (my two addictive sites) and being disinterested in the content if I do look at them (how did I ever find this dreck interesting?). I don't have statistics but at the start of the year I would spend most of the day on my laptop, now on a typical day I don't use my laptop at all and only use my phone for texting and looking up words in the language I'm learning.

I don't have an ingenious method or simple hack to get rid of your internet addiction, my approach was to keep introducing more and more friction into my device usage and continuing to plug away at it. This involved rather ridiculous methods. For instance I set my laptop password to a random 64 character string that I wrote down on a piece of paper. It can take me several minutes to get logged in now. Anyway, here are some observations about internet addiction I have. Doubtlessly unoriginal but it's what I have:

* Your internet addiction is almost certainly a coping mechanism for something else. This means unfortunately you're probably not going to kick your reddit habbit then be happy and healthy for the rest of your life. You need to fix your actual issues. The good news is you'll have lots of time to do this.

* I think it can be helpful to really, really think about how these sites fundamentally operate. They compete to get your attention and show you ads, or in other words they convert your life into revenue. It's deranged! Ironic detachment is the cultural norm right now it seems like but if you can get out of that and really feel just how disgusting social media is I think it can help a lot, especially when it gets hard. Paradoxically realizing I am a victim was empowering, it made my struggle meaningful.

* Pretty much everything is better ""analog"", the annoying parts that tech automates away are what enriches the experience. I'm not 100% on this though, for instance I think spotify has let me listen to a lot of interesting music I would never have encountered otherwise. But I'd recommend maintaining an attitude of extreme skepticism towards anything digital until it demonstrates otherwise.

* Real life meaningful relationships are indescribably beautiful and make being online seem incredibly pathetic in comparison. Please go make some friends if you don't have any, or become closer with them if you do have them (maybe that acquittance you have could be your bff if you got to know them better). I don't have the secret^TM to making friends either, but please try.

Don't have much else to say, like I said I don't have some secret technique or insight. I'm just a guy. I hope anyone reading this has a good 2023 and I look forward to not seeing you around!",2022-12-29 22:28:39,1672352919
nosurf,Authenticity and social media,"I've seen so many people say they're being vulnerable and authentic on Instagram. I don't buy it. Social media is performative by nature. We worry about what others will say or think, especially with cancel culture nowadays.

So I'm gonna slowly use my phone less and less.

nosurf,my experience growing up with and growing addicted to my smartphone.,"I'm a millennial and grew up with a shared home computer and internet use had to be scheduled around incoming calls. My parents were strict about it until we moved away from our family when I was starting highschool and everything kind of fell apart. 
When we got a seperate line just for internet everyone went their seperate way. My mother is a pill addict and would nod out in front of the  TV in the living room but would freak out if you tried to change the channel.  My dad was a workaholic and we hardly saw him. My parents wouldn't allow us to do any extracurriculars or go anywhere after school or have friends over until my brother was 16.  At 13 my brother moved the family computer into his basement bedroom and got an Xbox. He spent his time screaming at people in the game or talking to strangers in internet forums, amongst other things. Sometimes I would hang out with him downstairs and we would download music, work on homework, or use myspace while he would game on the Xbox. 
There was a shift when I bought my first touchscreen device I would still hang out with him but we didn't talk anymore he started screaming into his headphones at the TV and I was obsessed with whatever app I downloaded. He eventually was able to have people over for land parties and I started to sneak out of the house but we both put in the effort to try to socialize in person with people our own age. Looking back the lack of actual hands on parenting, unfettered access to the internet at a young age and poor socialization has led to a lot of bad habits for both of us and to be fair my parents did not know the internet would be so damaging in the long run, to them we were safely accounted for inside the house.

Early stage smart phones had internet access but cost so much money to use and looked so bad there was no point in scrolling. But that's why people carried multiple devices like a digital camera and a mp3 player. The new version of the smartphone where everything was merged seamlessly, the internet was accessible via a reasonably priced unlimited plan, websites were visually appealing and  apps supplemented what websites couldn't offer. That's when things changed.

Any question on any topic I could Google and recieve thousands of search results. The rabbit holes and deep dives resulted in thousands of hours wasted because very little of the information I learned about i retained. Then clickbait started to be a thing. So I would get distracted midway threw whatever I originally wanted to look up. 

 Back when you used computers for social media you could only upload your pictures from your  digital camera or scan a picture people didn't edit and filter things into oblivion, it was a much more humble type of sharing; you wanted to look good, but you didn't want to spend your time fussing with it to much. Smartphones led to the photo dumps and endless albums because people really wanted to share there experiences with everyone. Smartphones led to the normalization of  posting  the first thought in your head and without considering the ramifications of how it would look 10 years later. Smartphones make attention seeking behavior the erosion of healthy boundaries normal. 

 But to me the weirdest part was everyone treated social media like it was a novel way to interact with people you lost contact with years before. Sure in theory it's nice to reconnect with your old friends but historically once you moved on from one stage to another you didn't stay in contact with people unless effort was put forth by both people. Your elementary school friends you moved away from and hadn't heard from in 10 years were sending friend requests, the quiet kid you worked on a project that one time in middle school sent you a friend request, your high school bully sent you friend requests, your aunt's and uncles and grandparents sent you friend requests. Then people who knew someone you knew sent you friend requests.  It was like a tight rope waking  popularity contest in the circus. Online dating used to be seen as a last ditch effort for social outcasts now it's gone from being the norm to being on par with online shopping. Mental health has been rapidly declining in general for so many people. This all began around the time when people started curating their online persona which became their entire personality without the Photoshop and real life relationships started suffering.

I did the whole social media detox. I haven't Facebook in over 5 years, Instagram in 6 years, Snap Chat in like 7 years, LinkedIn in 3 years etc. I used reddit for about 3 years when I was severely  depressed and then I made the horrible decision to look up the content my brother posts using his social media handle. He uses it across every platform including linkedin. His reddit account broke me. The things I found were vile, hateful, radicalized, incel type  posts  so far removed from reality I decided to confront him and notify my parents of the extremist things he was doing online as an intervention. It destroyed what semblance of a family we had.  I unfortunately don't talk to my family of origin anymore because of it amongst other reasons.  I realized that if my brother was saying these things so flippantly on social media; reddit specifically, then there were others like him forming the hive mind mentality and if there were others like him I needed to reevaluate how I was spending my time with. I deleted my old account and did a series of self help/ self care things limiting my smartphone usage. I pulled myself up out of the depression but I feel myself slipping again.

 Having the knowledge of the world and the ability to connect with almost anyone in the entire world at my fingertips is such a powerful feeling but that power needs to be welded resposibly. My attention span is destroyed. I feel like I can't do anything unless I have some YouTube video playing or Spotify  in the background but then all my time goes into finding the perfect thing to distract myself with. My new years resolution is to block the most problematic compulsory things I seek out to decompress ( d list celebrity gossip) because it adds no value to my life.",2022-12-29 17:18:45,1672334325
nosurf,Is anyone's YouTube feed annoying littered with references to Andrew Huberman?,"Because he's a neuroscientist with a popular podcast, his name is tacked on to pretty much any video relating to dopamine, porn, video games, alcohol. It's not only annoying, but it seems to be bastardizing a complex field of science. 

Also just because someone is a neuroscientist doesn't mean everything he says about any remotely adjacent area is gospel. This is a mini rant and probably an unpopular one given many Redditors likely enjoy the Huberman Lab. 

To me though it's symptomatic of the Internet and YouTube overly simplifying complexity all in the name of clicks and ad revenue. Anyone else's YouTube feed littered with Andrew Huberman?",2022-12-29 17:01:47,1672333307
nosurf,Any tips for my pc to make it less enticing?,"I'm trying to get away from the screens in my life because I hate mindlessly scrolling, and my method has been to replace my modern tech with somewhat dated but still functional tech.

I sold my iPhone 13 and bought a 1st gen iPhone SE instead which has helped reduce my screen time but I'm still considering a dumbphone replacement.

I got a thinkpad x60 from the thrift store to replace my macbook and installed arch linux in an attempt to create a more functional machine not intended for content consumption. (This one has been much more difficult to transition to and I haven't completely yet)

Then I hackintoshed my gaming pc, sold the graphics card for one that only suits my needs outside of video games because I wanted to stop playing video games all of the time. I sold my gaming monitor as well and bought a smaller one to make video games and content consumption less enjoyable.

It's worked well and I'm not scrolling as much as I used to, but now whenever I do I feel much guilt because I've put so much in place to prevent myself from doing so. This whole time theres a part of me thinking maybe I'm being too hard on myself and depriving myself of a break. And I don't believe in a puritanical lifestyle; Something I don't think anyone can live up to nor should they want to. Who am I to say how other people should live though. Anyway, I'm writing this because I woke up this morning and went to my computer and started scrolling on my reddit homepage. I wasn't really looking for anything it just felt like a slot machine again. Ironic.

What do you guys do to prevent this habit? What else can I put between myself and the slot machine feeds? The parental controls for websites on macos only work sometimes and are really annoying when I actually want to learn something via youtube or reddit.",2022-12-29 15:45:23,1672328723
nosurf,I feel like social media makes me present a false sense of self...,"...and then try to adhere to that false version in my real life.

I recently got back from a two-week vacation where I was out of my regular routine and wasn't very online, and I felt a lot calmer, partially because I wasn't performing for anyone.

I wanted to carry that feeling into my daily life so I started paying attention to where I felt like I was performing the most, and it recently hit me that it mostly happens online. It's like I'm constantly subconsciously curating myself to present a certain version of myself digitally, even when I don't want to. And I don't like the feeling.

nosurf,4 month laptop websites hiatus and how it went,"Every social media except for streaming (Netflix) and Facebook (only groups) blocked. I did this because I didn’t want to use my laptop for a bunch of purposes besides research and homework. Even YouTube was blocked. 

How it went: My relationship with YouTube, Reddit, Instagram etc all changed for the better. However none of this changed my phone usage understandably. Today my blocks officially ended so I opened the websites again to see with a fresher pair of eyes the websites that held me in a chokehold. I feel overwhelmed and turned off, everything I hated about the website and the algorithms were the exact same. 

Am I cured? Absolutely not. This has been a continuous battle and I’m not where I want to be. That’s not to discredit what I tried out but just to say if you’re going to do it don’t give yourself so many loopholes. And never feel like at the end of all of it that you are too good to fail. That’s what happened when I returned to Reddit to research something that was taboo and had very limited information.

nosurf,Advice on Deleting Facebook / Things from the Past,"I used facebook on and off for I would guess 10 years and I think it's time to finally delete the account as it has been something that has affected me negatively for a while. The only thing I am worried about is the digital footprint left from my facebook.

I know there are other threads about deleting your facebook profile but I am not sure how up to date most of them are and some of them don't answer my questions so I hope making another thread won't be a problem. Now, my problem is that when I was much younger I posted a lot of stuff that I would like to have removed from my account. You know how when you're younger how you just post and share without thinking too much into it? Yeah, well that was my problem. I understand that when you post something it is never ""truly"" deleted but if I can do anything about it I will try.

My questions are:

1. I plan to go back and manually delete most of my posts on my page that are public (There isn't a LOT of stuff so I would rather do this by hand for the peace of mind.) Is this the best method for ensuring everything is deleted? I would prefer not to use some sort of software if manually deleting it would be a better method of guaranteeing everything is removed since it's not a ton in the first place.
2. I don't have a ton of messages on facebook since I mostly used it for posting stuff on my feed and such. I have a few conversations I don't mind manually deleting since again, it's not a lot, but I do not see a ""delete"" button for messages, just an ""unsend"" message. Is unsending the best that I can do if there's no delete button for messages?
3. I plan to delete my account after doing the above, some may say it's overboard but I want to make sure as much of it is gone as possible before deleting it. I see that facebook has a delete option in settings, is that what I want to use if I want to delete as much data as possible from my account?
4. Finally, after deleting my account it is from my understanding that everything that was associated with my account will be under ""Facebook User"" and not my name. Is this correct, and if so, should I do anything else before deleting my account?

nosurf,I’m addicted to reddit because it’s the only place I can be myself. How do I stop?,"TLDR: I’m living a lie, and it’s preventing me from forming any genuine social connections irl. Reddit is a source of comfort and the only place that I can be myself, which is why I’m addicted and why trying to quit has been so hard.

For context— I was born in a very conservative Muslim family but lost my faith in Islam a couple of years ago. I can’t tell my parents— I’d get disowned in a better case scenario. Even though I live in a secular state, I’m forced to wear a hijab, which makes connecting with like-minded people difficult— the only people at college who actually pursue friendships
with me are conservative Muslims. 

r/exmuslim is the only place that I feel understood and it’s been a source of comfort for me since I discovered it months ago. The problem is that the amount of time I’ve been spending on it is damaging— I know I should be focusing on college and pursuing financial independence, but it’s just *easier* to wallow in my room and read/comment/debate about Islam all the time. 

I haven’t had any issues cutting out other platforms, and I wouldn’t have much of an issue cutting out reddit either if it weren’t for this.

Has anyone here been in a similar situation? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",2022-12-28 23:38:16,1672270696

nosurf,What are your routines going to look like going into the new year?,"I feel like this will be fun! Anyone who’d like to, list your routine now and then list your routine in the new year if you plan to implement nosurf, and what it would look like to be a changed digital user!

Me currently: 

6:15 am - wake up, grab phone and Google random things, watch YouTube, do nothing for this time
6:45 am - get out of bed, watch more YouTube and eat, watch more YouTube
7:40 am - leave for work
8:30 am - start work, sit and Stare at computer for 7 hours, 1 hour lunch break where I stare at my phone and eat, and check my phone every 5 minutes throughout the day
4:30 pm - drive home, arrive at 5:00 and eat, watch tv, play games, scroll phone, text friends, watch movies with parents, 
10:00 - go to bed
Rinse and repeat unless I have plans with a friend or my partner.

Miserable isn’t it? And I only have 2 social media, Fb and Instagram. Gonna be getting rid of those in the new year. I want my new routine to look like this.

2023 me:
5:30 am - wake up, leave phone outside my room so it’s not the first thing I grab, go drink my greens and vitamin drink, go for a workout
6:30 am - shower, then eat healthy breakfast 
7:15 - check phone, have no social media or browser on there so I’m not tempted to scroll, put phone down after checking and responding to anyone 
7:40 am - leave for work, moderate my day between computer (I’m a data analyst), breaks, and walking, and standing, and balancing time on my phone during lunch/throughout the day. 
4:30 pm - leave work, try and make more plans to see friends, get out there more, if I go home I want to utilize my time better, learn my harmonica that’s been put away for years, read more books, do yoga, workout more, go outside, and just enjoy life instead of feeling like a slob.

We can do this everyone! I find listing out my planned schedule helps motivate me :)",2022-12-28 23:06:16,1672268776
nosurf,internet addiction,"hi, i'm a 15 year old girl who is  literally addicted to the internet.

I am on my computer for around 6 hours a day in the week and around 11 hours in the weekend.  And i am ruining my life and i don't know how to fix it. I had been introduced to the internet at the age of 4, my sister showed me this cool game called Moviestarplanet. I used to play this game with her a lot right up until the age of 7. That is when i first made my own account. I was quite literally addicted and played around 10 hours a day. At an age where i was supposed to be making friends i was, there i was sitting alone in my room as a 7 year old being depressed as fuck only having my online friends. But i found comfort in the game and real life was hard for me at that time. I'm 15 now and want to quit but i can't. The friends i have now are the sweetest people ever and i love them. But the problem is that they also are on the internet a lot and aren't really trying to quit like me. We don't hang out often even though i would like to, i don't have anything to do other then the internet. Please help me with my problem and how i can quit my addiction. Maybe also some tips on how to make my friends want to hang out more often and live a normal life. 

I'm wasting my life and before i know it i'm an adult, this makes me very upset.

Thankyou. (my first language isn't English so my apologies for any mistakes)",2022-12-28 22:07:47,1672265267
