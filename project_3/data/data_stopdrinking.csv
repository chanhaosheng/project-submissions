stopdrinking,"Day 1, again and I don’t feel hopeful.","Daily beer drinker here, for over a year. Last month I went 5 days without drinking but slipped up on day 6 and immediately went back to daily beer drinking. I did the same thing last summer - 5 days. Last week I did another 5 days, and the same thing happened. I tapered down my beer consumption before each of my sober stretches, but when I slip up on day 6, I go right back to drinking even more beer than before. I don’t know why day 6 gets to me? Days 2 and 3 are physically the hardest. Headache, anxiety, bad stomach, sore muscles, tired, emotional. But the 6th day I just have absolutely NO willpower or something? Its like I cannot stop myself. I know that sounds stupid. If I can make it through 5 days why can’t I make it to a week? Or a month? I just want this out of my life for good. I don’t want to keep failing because I understand that it makes it even harder to quit…Kindling effect or whatever. Do I just actually subconsciously want to sabotage my life? Idk. I’m seeing an addictions counsellor in May. My goal is to be sober from now til then. But I’m afraid that I can’t even hit the week mark. I feel like a stupid loser, tbh.",2023-03-06 15:39:40,1678117180
stopdrinking,"33 days, one day closer to my new high score","Hello, checking in again. I'm trying to do that more often as I think the additional community support would help my sobriety. I long to be able to hit 50 and say I had been sober for nearly 2 decades. Unfortunately that is not the case today. Looking for ways to do more service work in my community, I signed up to help with homelessness outreach on Saturday so we'll see how that goes. I don't think sitting around in my own head on the boob tube is helping my sobriety but I lack the concentration to get deeply into my hobbies. Hopefully the longer I stay sober, the better my focus will be because as it stands, I can't read more than a few pages of a book at a time. Distraction is a powerful sobriety tool and I hope keeping busy by working 50 hours a week and volunteering around town will help. A sense of purpose and clarity would greatly aid my sober journey.",2023-03-06 15:38:38,1678117118
stopdrinking,Dumped a bottle of whiskey I found stashed,"It’s been almost 40 days since my last relapse. Yesterday my phone fell into some ungodly pit of Mordor in my car and as I was digging for it I felt a familiar shape. A cheap plastic pint. 

I went to pull it out from where it was wedged under my seat and heard the worst possible thing which was liquid still sloshing around. The fucking thing was about still 1/3 full. 

Judging from the brand of whiskey I knew exactly what relapse this was from. This bottle had probably been in there for like 9 months probably and somehow I missed it on the multiple times I’d gone hunting for some booze I might have “forgot” in my car 

I’ve learned the hard way relapsing on stuff I found that I’d stashed blacked out so I didn’t give myself time to think and I dumped it 

And guess what? I went on to have an absolutely terrible day where almost nothing went right but I’m so glad I made that choice. At least one thing went right.

stopdrinking,1 year today and it has been life changing!," It was a year ago when I said “enough is enough” and just quit. Quitting had some nice side effects as well.

stopdrinking,I see so much success here and I want to be a part of it.,"I started drinking in-earnest around 2016, and nowadays, I can get by somewhere between 3-5 days before I give in. I'm seeing a psychiatrist  and I'm currently on campral gabapentin, which have given me a modicum of control over the last few months; I used to get wasted every night, and I was going though around 2L of gin per week. That's dropped to less than a 750ml bottle, but IMO it's still too much. I can't sleep, so I take ambien every night, which works most of the time, though last night I took it at like 8:45 and by 11:30 I got desperate and downed two bottles of soju. The gabapentin has doused what was left of my libido, which leaves my partner out in the cold so to speak. They're super chill about it, but it bothers me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can essentially trace all of the bad in my life to the bottle, and I want to stop. It seems like each time I do I end up sabotaging myself, or somehow convincing myself that circumstances should allow me to drink. I'm here to try to turn that around. I just poured all of the booze in the house down the drain, so there's that. Once the cravings hit though, I need to remain focused on just that day, or so I've heard.",2023-03-06 15:26:48,1678116408
stopdrinking,Day 1,"Going to give this a try. Been drinking on and off, 3-6 drinks a day for about 6 years now.    Mostly the big white claws.  I tried vodka a few times but wasn’t good at managing my “dose” and drinking enough fluids with it, so I’ve spent a lot of money on the more expensive 5-8% stuff. I have some health conditions that make it a very good reason for me to stop.   I also have to start saving more money for my family, 1yo daughter, and I want to generally remember more of my life.    I feel like some days, if I start drinking early, drinking more doesn’t sound like a bad idea.  Then I’m irritable, borderline black-out sometimes, tired, hung over the next day.   The day is gone.  This is my first time typing out my intention to quit…",2023-03-06 15:17:53,1678115873

stopdrinking,501 days ago I was drinking 24 hours a day.,"I had resigned myself to possibly dying, at the least I was going to lose my job and my girlfriend. I would drift out of consciousness for a couple hours at a time but truly hadn't slept in many months. I would gulp down a beer, tightening my stomach muscles to not immediately throw it up, waiting for the numbing effects to trickle in before I could switch to a harder alcohol.  And that's how I spent my days, attempting to briefly taper off before the poison took over my life all over again. 

It really takes surrendering and being open to any and all help before you can begin to escape the trap. If you've ever said, ""That doesn't sound like it will work for me"" or ""That's not my kind of thing"", try it anyway, even only once or a week or a month. The best advice I got from a guy in rehab was the 'buffet method'. A little bit of AA, a little meditation, medication, prayer, exercise.. use some of it, all of it or none of it, you might be surprised how wonderful one or the other is for you.

As someone who was very adamant that various treatments or techniques wouldn't be useful for me, I found that just trying them contributed to the whole of helping me escape the prison of alcohol. We can all do it, one day at a time until you're not even aware 500 days have passed. Here's to the first 500 and 500 more.",2023-03-06 15:03:32,1678115012

stopdrinking,Feeling deeply depressed after deciding stop drinking 4 days ago due.,"5 days ago I blacked out whilst out drinking and completely ruined the night, argued and was a complete mess. 

This is not the first time this has happened by a long shot - it probably happens 40% of nights that I decide to drink or go on a night out and go out and although I am not a daily drinker I have an undeniable problem with binge drinking.

I have ended up in hospital for alcohol poisoning before, had friendship ending arguments, overshared, passed out (So. Many. Times. On the concrete.), almost choked on my own vomit in my sleep, almost been coerced into going home with strange men (no memory of this, only told to me by friends who looked after me) and I every single day I ruminate on stupid bad decisions I've made whilst drinking.

Once I start I fully cannot stop, it temporarily alleviates all the bad feelings but the consequences are so bad and I have decided I cannot do it anymore.

However making this decision, starting a ""days sober"" calendar, has somehow made me feel worse. I feel so shameful looking back on all these things I've done. 

Maybe it's because I'm admitting it's a problem and therefore accepting how bad my behaviour whilst drunk has been. I feel so depressed and I hope it lifts soon. And it's stings equally that I won't be able to chill this evening and take my mind off it with a few beers or something.

Does it get easier to forgive yourself and feel okay?",2023-03-06 15:03:18,1678114998
stopdrinking,My (29M) final straw with love of 2 years,"I started on this no-alcohol journey 4 years ago. Made it 14 months before relapsing first go around. Then made it 10 months second time. Drank in secret for about a year until got arrested. 3 months no alcohol post arrest then checked went hard again until ended up into detox. Post detox made it 1 week until a 1 month bender that ended 6 days ago. 

The only reason that got me to stop this time is my GF and love of my life was going to breakup with me due to my actions and continuous drinking. If I get drunk again I will lose her. I don’t want to drink. I cant. I am an alcoholic. 

AA is the one place that has really got me to the year sober mark in the past - but I’m so disconnected with AA/the steps (and also the guilt in the rooms due to MJ I smoke on the side) that I don’t want to go back to AA. 

What do you alcoholics do besides AA without white knuckling to stay sober and be happy long term?",2023-03-06 15:02:47,1678114967
stopdrinking,The Coin Flip,"While I was drinking, there’d be nights when I felt conflicted. Should I stay sober tonight or go buy more booze? That’s when I’d flip a coin. Heads, I drink. Tails, I don’t.

More often than not I still drank when it landed on tails. Or did a best 2/3. Sometimes it kept me sober that night but rarely.

I’m on day 52 sober and the “pink cloud” has lifted. Now and then while at the store (or in close range of the liquor store) I find myself conflicted. That’s when the coin returns…

I’ve been tempted to drink often the past few days. Even when I flip heads, I choose not to drink. I feel 100% better. I’m not depressed or stressed out. I regularly attend AA and have the chips to prove it. I anticipate spending time with my family newly sober. I sleep much better. I can take my medicine again. All in all, I’m happy.

Yet I keep going back to that coin….

stopdrinking,Really struggling with sleep since being mostly sober and wondering if anyone has any suggestions.,"From a positive side, so far, 2023 has been the year I've drank the least so far since I started drinking, essentially. I've had successful ""long breaks"" where I'd take 2-3 months of very isolated sobriety, but thus far this year I've been able to be sober at least 2/3rds of the days so far, and am finding myself capable of leaving alcohol behind for weeks in a row, or drink 1-2 nights in a week and manage not to drink the other days.

But the rest of things aren't going so well, especially with sleep. I broke my pelvis in July of last year, and continued complications leave me isolated in the house all day. I have no job, no idea when I'll get one, and no even slightly potential romantic relationships. I can't do much around the house, or with friends or family. Exercise of any use is out of the question.

That's led to my sleep schedule becoming abhorrent, especially on sober nights. I'm practically nocturnal, although my body sometimes lets me sleep 2-3 hours at night before getting back up and having to sleep later. Melatonin and sleep aids seem to just make me groggy and hate my waking time. The worst part is that my mind just won't shut down when the TV turns off, or I log off of the internet/games where I'm distracting myself. As soon as it's dark and the lights are out, my brain kicks into overtime and I just go pure negative thought, like into how I'll never recover my health, my friends are gone, and money problems are mounting.

It's so bad that the other week I was up for 33 hours straight. I'm currently posting this at 6:30 AM and woke up yesterday at 4:45 PM. Alcohol used to help me quiet my worries for a bit and now I don't know how to stop. Thoughts? Thanks for any help.",2023-03-06 14:37:18,1678113438
stopdrinking,Faceing a challange in 2 days - I am scared,"Did not have a drink roughly for 6 weeks now. I have no desire to do so. That is amazing achievement!  
But... in 2 days I will meet my ex. I think I kinda got over her but not really, never stopped loving her.  
When we broke up a few months ago, I was drinking heavily, every night getting drunk. Throwing up. Continue drinking even after that..  


Now I have stabilised my life, found a flat, job, daily habits.  
I think she as well.   


My point is: I am scared. Love or the lack of it is the biggest trigger for me to drink. If this goes wrong, for example turns out that I grew but not enough.. or she hasn't changed soem things. Or somehow it goes sideway.  
I am scared, that craving for dirnking will outweight my brain and will just happen again, and all the goo feeling I have been workon on SO hard for the past 3 months (started before my last drink), just goes back to stage 1.  


Also, it would make me feel super weak, like she (or someone) can have such effect on me that my core, not drinking, exercising, working on my goals.. jsut gonna shatter to pieces.  


How can I prepare? What do I have to keep in mind? How do I prepare being triggerd to drink becuase of love (or the lack of it)?",2023-03-06 14:35:27,1678113327
stopdrinking,Sobriety lives company?,"Went to a cabin with extended family this weekend; definitely a drinking event for us all in the past. But this time I brought a cooler with a variety of NA beers. I'm proud of myself for not drinking, as I had been worried. 

But even better, I got my cousin and Dad to try them, and they were impressed enough that neither had any alcohol the whole weekend and just drank those. I even gave my cousin some to take home. I don't expect nor necessarily want either of them to give up alcohol (they don't have the same challenges with it that I do), but it will be nice to share some NA drinks with them in the future.",2023-03-06 14:34:20,1678113260
stopdrinking,Beginning Again,"Day 1 (again)
I’ve made it to 30 days AF twice now, then I slip up and eventually go back to daily drinking 6 to 12 beers. 

This time I had a business trip at the end of January and was excited to be out on my own. (I work from home, married, with 3 young kids.) I decided  to drink a few beers while waiting around at the airport, like it was “a special occasion”. And here I am, 5 weeks later, back to my old habits. 

For me, the worst things about daily drinking is I feel mildly depressed, and a lack of energy. Quitting for 30 days taught me how much better I can feel… but somehow that’s so easy to forget. 

In January, I told everyone I know that I was planning to quit for at least 365 days. I thought that would create accountability to help me get through this. Didn’t work. I think this time I will keep my plans to myself, and just politely decline a drink when it’s offered. 😌",2023-03-06 14:30:05,1678113005
stopdrinking,"""Normal"" drinking is still horrible.","After months of sobriety I joined my co-workers at the bar last weekend. Had a few cocktails, then a few pints. I took my time, didn't get too drunk, didn't say anything embarrassing or throw up. By all accounts I was drinking ""in moderation"".

But... I didn't have more fun than usual. I wasn't more social or extroverted. What benefit did the drinks actually give me?

And I felt terrible the day after. Exhausted, useless, sick to my stomach. I didn't achieve a single one of my goals for the day. And for what? I could have hung out with my coworkers completely sober and been fine the next day.

Too many times I've fallen into the trap of thinking there's ""good"" drinking and ""bad"" drinking, but the actual truth is that normal drinking is terrible for you. Just because I don't qualify as an ""alcoholic"" doesn't mean alcohol isn't doing damage to me. It makes me feel like shit.

I think I'm okay with letting other people drink themselves stupid. I'm just so done with it.",2023-03-06 14:29:18,1678112958
stopdrinking,"A thought 500 days in: 'Stop drinking' is an action, 'Sober' is an identity, and they're both important.","I divide up action and identity because they're both separate sticking points in my opinion. When you first stop drinking, there's some very really hard biological things going on with how the alcohol effects your body. Your habits are very ingrained and to me it's a game of overriding them, riding out the negative feelings of quitting an addiction and embracing the positive feelings of not being drunk/hungover. Lot of day 1s and week 1s there. But then after you make it out, the immediate biological and habitual urges decline. Days to weeks, turn to months, etc... 

This isn't the longest streak of *not drinking* I've ever had, but it's the first one where I wear ""sober"" as an identity. Eventually, when the immediate strong memories of why I quit fade, when *not drinking* is simply the day to day state I exist in, what keeps me there? My past long streaks weren't ended by losing a tough battle of willpower, it was more like I forgot why I did it to begin with, and they just kinda happened. 

I like reading self improvement books, and a recent one was called Atomic Habits. I didn't take a ton from it, but a salient point the author made was that some of the strongest lasting habits are ones based around your identity. [Here's an excerpt from the book if you're so inclined.](https://jamesclear.com/identity-based-habits) The important part from the excerpt: 

&gt;The first layer is changing your outcomes. This level is concerned with changing your results: losing weight, publishing a book, winning a championship. Most of the goals you set are associated with this level of change.

&gt;The second layer is changing your process. This level is concerned with changing your habits and systems: implementing a new routine at the gym, decluttering your desk for better workflow, developing a meditation practice. Most of the habits you build are associated with this level.

These two represent ""stop drinking"" the action, and they're the most important when a problem is first identified. If you even made it to this point, let alone past, congrats, it ain't easy. 

&gt;The third and deepest layer is changing your identity. This level is concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your self-image, your judgments about yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level.

This to me is the key to long term success, and why I am embracing sober as an identity. I'm not sure why this is just now dawning on me, I suppose in the past I didn't want to seem uncool as a person who didn't drink, or even preachy. Now I'm not saying I'm gonna be constantly reminding people of it, but certainly I will be reminding *me* in my mind. I will keep a hard physical totem of it here, in terms of day counts. I still enjoy listening to others peoples tales of sobriety.

stopdrinking,Memorial service for a fallen friend last night. Feeling sad but also thankful today.,"Last year a guy I play sports with disappeared.  He was someone I knew only socially there, and of course like so many seemed to be making his way through life okay.  Turns out that wasn't the case at all.  This friend of mine shared my disease and I had no idea, and he unfortunately spiraled out of control one last time and decided to end his life.  He left behind two kids and a girlfriend who all loved him very much.  We didn't find out what happened to him until January, when he was found alone in the woods with a gun in his hand.

There but for the grace of God.  Roughly the same age, both alcoholics with two kids and steady work.  I'm here, he's not.  Every day for the rest of my life is a blessing I won't take for granted.  My presence on this earth, just like his, does matter to people.  Just like all of ours does.  I won't judge anyone for whom the pain is too much, but I will always try to remember and remind people that it's okay to struggle and sharing that burden makes us human.  Death is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.  

Alcohol is death for many of us, either from the drug itself or from the things it causes.  Be careful, be safe, and remember you matter and can share your pain.",2023-03-06 14:04:04,1678111444

I genuinely think for the first time, I’m going to make a real concerted effort to not drink. It only makes everything feel and seem worse than it is. I’m bigger than I’ve ever been and a feel like I’m ruining my life. I also definitely need to start setting bigger and better boundaries. I do too much for other people and it’s driving me crazy.

For the role, I moved to a new city where I know no one.

I worked in the restaurant industry my whole life before switching professions and thought that having a higher paying job would make me happier, but it hasn't. I was 2.5 years sober before moving into this field. I thought that since I was able to run a bar and be sober that this would be even easier. Not the case. In fact, it is even harder to avoid it. I really miss the restaurant industry, I made less money, but I was definitely happier. I tell myself every week that I'm not going to drink, but usually it doesn't turn out that way. I don't know how much longer I can go on doing this job. I think it's time to move on and get back into the restaurant industry, which has always been a passion of mine.

stopdrinking,Be careful about dishing out pink cloud dogma,"Too often I see recently sober folks come here to express their excitement and gratitude for their new lease on life just to have their enthusiasm crushed by the “pink cloud” comments. 

If someone feels like sharing their successes and your knee jerk reaction is to tell them they don’t know how hard it gets, look inwards as to why.

The hard work of staying sober starts on day one. Don’t put others down because they’re not currently struggling as hard as you.

Also a lot of difficulty falling asleep. Is this normal? I thought I would have been more or less past most of the physiological symptoms after 72 hours of not drinking.

stopdrinking,Lori Gottlieb quote,"*”Insight is the booby prize of therapy“ is my favorite maxim of the trade, meaning that you can have all the insight in the world, but if you don’t change when you’re out in the world, the insight and the therapy is worthless. Insight allows you to ask yourself, ""Is this something that’s being done to me or am I doing it to myself?“. The answer gives you choices, but it’s up to you to make them.*

Often I’ve been pumped up by some platitude or bit of wisdom but then when I step out my door into the sunlight of the everyday world a kind of “post nut clarity” hits me and the euphoria of my recent epiphany turns to a vapor.

I’ve learned (and the above quote testifies to the fact) I’ve actually have to roll up my sleeves and *do the work* of adopting the new found insight. And that’s easier said than done when sunlight of the everyday world hits you.

That I’ve literally never once followed through with.

I will forever find a reason to drink. Every emotion and any day of the week is a reason I’ll use to drink. 

Last night I decided to have a “few” beers.  So obviously I got hammered. I lost my cell phone in my tiny apartment. Then I proceeded to have a total meltdown. I broke my laptop and coffee table out of anger. Which I think is probably partially me being overly emotional because I was drinking. And probably pent up emotions.

My boyfriend was 2 months sober, and he relapsed 2 weeks ago. I wanted so badly to drink with him but stopped myself just barely. Tonight, I left work early because he told me he needed me. He puked blood. Worse then I've ever seen. He didn't want to go to the hospital right away. I finally got him to go. The old me (the drunk me) would've said if we aren't going to the hospital right this second, I'll finish your booze, get more, and believe everything would be fine in the morning.

If drunk me was in charge, he'd probably be gone by the time I woke up. You dont need the horror story, but it was far more serious than I thought. I started my sobriety because of him. The longer I stick to it, the more I enjoy it for myself. 

So tonight, I sit in the ER seeing how bad things can get and knowing they could be much worse. I can't stop others, but i can stop myself. You can choose to be an example to others. I'm choosing to show others that stopping is possible. I don't want to be another threat/scary story of what can go wrong. I want to be an example of what can go right.

He gave me some type of medicine to cool down, because my trembling was so severe in the waiting room I was shaking and gagging so heavily. After my medicine I think he called it subotril or sobril or something idk, I came down within 30 mins but my pulse was still way over.

It’s definitely so that I can get a nice buzz going in the evening after my toddler goes to sleep for the night.

So much of my week is portioned out to other things, and when I’m home it just feels like I’m on my own. 
Yesterday, I got my two beers, but I also got a shooter. I don’t remember going to bed last night. I remember working on beer #2 on the porch while partner stayed inside with our daughter.

stopdrinking,"Did the worst thing I’ve ever done last night, now I’m on day one.","Okay, this is going to be long but I need to get this off my chest and have never had the courage to share in a meeting:
This is not my first quit date, nor is it my first sober attempt. I’m 25 and didn’t really start drinking heavily till I was probably 20 years old. At first it seems harmless, a couple beers out with friends, maybe a glass of whiskey with my dad or my brother. But that’s how all these stories start isn’t it? 
My first rock bottom came when I was 22, I had gone through a terrible break up, dropped out of school, quit the field I love, moved to a new city, fell into a group of hard drug users in that city and moved back home with my parents. I would go to class at community college (which I thought was beneath me, I was a real piece of work) and after class would go buy a bottle of wine or cheap whiskey and drink it in my car next to the park and do it again. I realized I needed to stop when I was driving while chugging a bottle of wine. 
My next sober attempt came when the pandemic started, I was full of shame and fear about what was happening and turned to my old friend booze. But my lovely and amazing girlfriend told me to stop and I listened and didn’t drink for two years. 
Then I moved to Chicago, got into a great school, moved in with my amazing girlfriend who I want to marry. I was excelling in school for the first time in my life and I was generally happy. I could even drink in moderation. 
Then last night happened. 
I went to a party, had beers, shots, vodka, whiskey, pulling straight from the bottle. I was blasted. (That does not excuse what I did). I was completely blacked out. 
I left with a female friend of mine. In the Uber to drop her off I made disgusting comments about how I wanted to fuck her. I kissed her without her consent, I unzipped her coat when she told me not to get out of the car and kissed her and felt her up under her shirt without her consent. I said bye, got back in the Uber and stumbled into bed. Then today I remembered. Now I’m at risk of being expelled (which I deserve honestly), I have lost so many friends, and I’m super testing my girlfriends loyalty (the fact that she is staying with me is an incredible testament to the person she is). I don’t know what to do next. I have written a letter of apology, but otherwise I don’t know what to do. But I do know one thing, no matter what I do, booze won’t be there and booze won’t be a part of it.

stopdrinking,He choose drinking over me,"(Throwaway account).
I've been a lurker and a reader of this sub for a while. I've been sober for some months as I've decided not to poison myself anymore. My intrest in alcohol has weaned over the years and I'm not by any means an alcoholic. Since my father was diagnosed with terminal stage cyrrosis, I've kept away from alcohol.

I'm sure like many others on this sub my dad was an alcoholic.

Last year I met a guy and we dated for some time. His dad was an alcoholic too and he admitted having had a drinking problem in the past but he also said he didn't want to end like his father...

He broke up with me some 3 months later and the reasons I gave, I'm sure now, are not the real issue here.

First of all, he had had other drugs addiction in the past but what he did not tell me was that he was still struggling with drinking while we were dating. He hid it from me. When we would spend time together he would moderately drinking or not drink at all.
I was absolutely clueless but looking back there were so many hints. He has the keys to my place and he dried up my martini and gins (I only know because he brought a bottle one day to replace the one he emptied). When he would spend the night he would sweat like crazy (and I thought it to be side effects of other medicine he took).

Basically, the more time he spent with me the less he would drink. Before breaking up I guess that he wanted to spend more time drinking than not and I was in the way between him and his drink... 

After breaking up he admitted that he drank wine in the evening alone but that he wanted to stop the habit and was working on it... 


Some time later we got back in touch and we were both much healthier people or so I thought. We decided to see each other regularly but not being in a relationship for the time being because we both need to do some work on ourselves. 

He explained to me that he wanted to stop drinking home alone while still drink on weekends and see his friends. Only I've been on this sub long enough to know that some people can't moderate drink.


The brain, the addiction, doesn't give a shit if it's Friday night and you're drinking with friends or if it's a week night. My ex is just kidding himself, lying to himself that he wants to stop drinking, because he doesn't really. The people he sees on Friday night are drink buddies he does not see otherwise if not for drinking. 


I told him that if he would see them for the friendship, he wouldn't need to drink to spend time with them, he could stay sober. 


There was an event on a Friday to which I didn't even invite him, but he told me in advance he would attend. On the same afternoon he even confirmed he'll pass by. At 22:30 he wrote me that he won't come because he drank with his friends and by showing up he wouldn't make a ""good impression"". For me not showing up was worse. 

I told him I have a problem with his drinking problem and that if he wants to be a part of my life, he has to give up drinking. 


His answer was ""then I guess we shouldn't see each other in the future anymore"". 


I don't know if you've ever been on the other side of this conversation, but let me tell you, it's awful to be always second place after the addiction. 

We think about things alike, we have similar intrest, he has a heart of gold 
.. But he doesn't realize that alcohol makes him a liar and unreliable. I don't want to be afraid that he'll drop the ball on me every time something happens.. 

I also don't want to be an enabler and be close to him and watch him relapse and get better in an endless loop...",2023-03-06 07:43:23,1678088603
stopdrinking,"1 week Sober, it really feels like a fresh start","A week ago I was waking up with a very bad hangover, sick, after a night alone in my flat. It was a real wake up call, and after a few years of self-indulgence, it was time for me to go to the sober-side of the Force. 

So far, so good! I managed to go through the week-end quite easily, I read a ton of post on this genius subreddit, and listened to several podcasts. This content was like ""upvote"" for my decision. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was diagnosed with a neurological chronic condition less than 2 years ago. Then I received a late ADD diagnostic. I was a very regular drinker, I would drink on my own a few beers a night, and I never wanted to stop when I was at parties. I would forget so much, and embarass myself to various degrees.

A few months ago I left a long-time relationship, and moved across the country. Beers are so easy to grab around here... And wine was the perfect accessory for the ""newly single"" story I had in mind. What a trap is was!

&amp;#x200B;

I am impressed by everyone in this subreddit, and I hope to become as ""inspirational"" within the next years. I was fresh in the morning, energized, I feel like I have never done that much in a day. I am going to the gym, crocheting, I finished tons of projects in my flat this week-end, it is so good!

My mind is clear, my skyrocketing anxiety is getting significantly better. I have had a AD treatment for the past 3 years and I am realizing that I might have completely jeopardized my treatment by drinking. What a waste it has been! 

Next week I am going on a work trip 1h away from my new town. Usually I would book a hotel night and finish the night wasted with colleagues (never a good idea). The next day would be useless. This time I will leave for the day and come back the same night. I'll stay for a diet coke with the colleagues (socializing it still important) before leaving them to go back to my home, and it feels great.

I’ve saved a fortune (well, spent on other things), become so fucking productive, launched a nonprofit company, been killing it in my day to day work, been present, read a load of books, quit smoking, killed my tv habit, been to a concert, two family holidays, and the odd pub, not really had any cravings either! Anxiety is somewhat in check, not waking up every morning feeling like death is a godsend. 

And I’ve hung on until today, I’m on holiday in Hanoi and really wanted to do it sober, first proper non-drinking holiday, it’s just… this is the first time I’m finding it hard, I mean, so far it’s not insurmountable, I’m just worried that I’ll give in, despite feeling like I won’t, anyone ever get that? 

Anyway, been lurking around here and just thought I’d see what you all thought. IWNDWYT",2023-03-06 07:23:48,1678087428
stopdrinking,"My depression is gone, but I’m still drinking.","For a year now I was diagnosed with depression. I’m taking medication for it.

But before I got diagnosed, the sign was basically that I had to cry in my car before getting home.

My life is perfect in every way, I’ve achieved everything I ever dreamed of, I have money, kids, hot wife, properties I rent out for extra cash, a live-in Nani to make sure I don’t need to wake-up for the kids or clean/cook, sleep in my man cave with my video games, 100% paid house in cash, and work in a field that is exactly made for me. That’s what made depression suck so much, the whole “why am I feeling like this??”

So I started drinking beers in the morning before going to work, then on my lunch break I’d just be in the car watching YouTube and top my buzz with some vodka. Then when I got home, I’d top myself up with some more vodka before playing with the kids.

Told my psychiatrist (and also my boss, cause fuck it) all this. Doc gave me some anti-depressants, and boss gave me less work + a new car.

Life was fine. I was self medicating myself with alcohol, and the drugs helped too. Job gave me incentives, but that doesn’t help my brain although it should… anywhoos, no more crying.

My doc said it’s because I’m chasing that endorphine hit. I’m perfectly happy, so nothing makes me happy anymore, not even video games. Maybe my lack of endorphines is due to my r/DeadBedrooms, or maybe I need a hobby or something to challenge myself and receive more endorphine hits. Like the gym.

Anyways, fuck the gym, alcohol did the trick, no need for hobbies or sex.

Now it’s been 2 months that I’ve felt zero depression. I’m ok now, and I’m going to slowly get off my medication. I even sometimes forget to take them and I see no change.

The issue is the alcohol now. I’ve built this routine of drinking 24/7 and it’s hard to get off of. This sucks. Even being drunk isn’t fun anymore. But I like the pain of drinking hard alcohol.

How do I get off of it?!

My last resort is to just fly to Amsterdam and do some mushrooms, I used to go there every year and come back with a clear and straight mind. But haven’t gone there in 3 years.

I feel like I need to get my ass kicked with an out of body experience to look at myself and parent myself back to normal.

I took a sick day off work today, so I could eat burritos, drink some whisky, and play video games in the morning.

This post doesn’t have a question. I’m just drunk and want to read this after my pass out nap at noon, and read some comments.",2023-03-06 07:00:37,1678086037
stopdrinking,I'm gonna have such a good day tomorrow,"I drank last night. It was Saturday night, so I figured ""why not?"" Went to a bar and did some work stuff on my laptop while sipping one drink of tequila, then stopped by the liquor store on my way home thinking ""well, if I had one, I should have some more"".

Wish I didn't do that, but this is a habit I'll be quitting a day at a time. On the plus side, I had only 375ml of Jack + one more drink before that. That's LESS than I normally do, so good on me for not going too hard. But I'm still feeling a bit dulled today.

Won't be drinking tonight, and it's pointless to shame myself or overanalyze why I got drunk last night, so

Here's a list of reasons I'll enjoy my sober tomorrow more than I enjoyed my hungover today:

* I'll have gotten a good 8+ hours of sleep, so my brain and body will be in tip-top shape. I won't spend the first bit of my day immobilized in bed waiting for the last of the booze to wear off.
* I won't be nauseous and lacking an appetite, slowly eating my first meal of the day. I'll be hungry and devour that stuff quickly.
* I'll show up to the gym and crush my workout.
* I'll be sharp and well-rested, so I'll have a way easier time handling mental tasks. And I'll feel more present, and be in a better mood.
* I won't be waiting for the day to be over so I can finally sleep off a hangover.
* I won't be calculating how much I can drink to get tipsy but not completely out of service the next day.
* When I run into people I know, I won't be telling them ""a bit hungover, but I'm holding up"" when we ask each other how we're doing.

Overall, sober me is a hell of a lot sharper, happier, more efficient, and present in the moment than drunk or hungover me is. Can't wait to be him tomorrow.

As for quitting alcohol entirely, I don't expect there to be some day in the future where I can finally say ""yay! I've quit compulsively binge drinking for the rest of my life!"" All I can do is make the decision not to drink every damn night, and be okay with being ""bored"" instead of getting drunk to avoid it.",2023-03-06 06:32:25,1678084345
stopdrinking,Heartbroken over leaving my bonus children,"Leaving my soon to be ex husband would have happened a lot earlier, had he not had these wonderful children that I got the chance to know and love. I left for a few months last year, and couldn’t bear the thought of being away from the kids, so I found a house to rent on the same street. I saw them every single day. This time around, I’ve filed for divorce as of a couple weeks ago and we are still in the same home, albeit different rooms for months. This week I should really start the search for my own place, just to maintain my boundaries with my ex, especially since he’s still drinking. 

I’m overwhelmed at the thought of being away from these boys. I’ve no legal or genetic ties post divorce, but I’ve loved these babies as my own for years now. We have primary custody, with bio mom getting every other weekend. I won’t sugar coat it—she ain’t great, but she does try in the way she knows how.

I just feel like I’m abandoning them. That they’ll grow up thinking they aren’t enough. That I didn’t love them enough to stay.  That couldn’t be further from the truth—I’d take them with me if the law allowed. I’m their safe place. I’m the one that kisses the boo boos and packs the lunches. I’m the team mom who has never missed an event or award ceremony. I’m the parent that does the parties, the hours of homework, etc. And I love that role so much. All I’ve ever wanted to do was to be a mom.

To make matters even more complicated, we are a completely blended family. His three sons and my daughter… my husband is the dad that she’s known her whole life, even before she was born. While she sees her bio dad every other weekend, she doesn’t have the relationship with him that she does my husband. My husband is her person. Those bonus kids of mine are her brothers and she is their sister through and through. Breaking up a family of children is devastating. I know I can’t stay any longer, as it’s not healthy, but there are so many risks. In Texas, there isn’t a preferred parent—they just prefer stability. I could essentially lose my daughter by leaving as well, despite the fact that she’s always been here with me and I’m a great mom. My ex is just waiting for the opportunity to jump in and try and take her. He always has been.

I committed to choose and love these bonus kids no matter what and I want to be able to be there for them. Goodness, divorce sucks even when it’s the right thing. I’m not sad about my marriage ending. I’m just sad that my sons won’t have me day to day. That my daughter won’t have her dad or her brothers.

If you made it this far, thank you. I’m a sobbing mess and just needed to vocalize this for transparency. I’m not at risk of drinking. I just feel like my heart is breaking and will never recover.",2023-03-06 06:28:04,1678084084

I lost a lot of money paying for a funeral recently and I have been working so hard to make that money back and when I drink, I spend way over my daily budget in one sitting and it's just not worth it. Also, it's wasting money on poison so it's a double whammy on ""what's the point? What am I getting out of this?""

It is hard to keep going some days, but I got some additional motivation the other day. Was picking up my daughter at preschool and the teachers asked if I had lost weight because it was noticable.

Guys don't tend to get compliments often. I still remember compliments from like 2006 (lol) so it was definitely something extra to help keep going.

stopdrinking,Monday meeting of the Sober People Getting Shit Done Club,"When I was drinking, I did shit (meaning, nothing). In contrast, now that I’m a non-drinker, I’m getting shit done. In fact, productivity has become one of my favorite parts of being sober. 

Has this been true for you, too? Without the endless cycle of wasting time while drinking followed by recovering from a hangover, do you find yourself with extra hours in the day to do constructive things, such as finally finishing that book you’ve been reading or tackling that mess in the garage? If so, I invite you to join the Sober People Getting Shit Done Club.

In order to be a member of this club, you must do three things:

1. Get something done. 

2. Be sober while doing it. 

3. Tell us about it.

**I’ll go first:** I used to LOVE baking, going back as far as my childhood (when I had “Mary’s Baking Service,” where I would make and deliver fresh bread or boxes of homemade cookies to people’s homes—my first job!), but when I started drinking heavily, baking was one of the many things that fell by the wayside. (Unlike cooking, where there’s a lot of room for improvisation and just winging it, baking is an exact science that can easily go wrong and requires care and focus, neither of which I had as a heavy drinker.) It took me a long time into sobriety to start baking again, but I recently have and found I love it just as much as I always did. 

I am planning a dinner party for my brother’s birthday, and I already know what cake I’ll be making. (It’s a flourless chocolate cake recipe from the *New York Times.*) I have never made this cake before, and it’s common wisdom that you should try a recipe once before you serve it at a party, but since I’m no longer drinking and therefore not liable to forget the cake in the oven or accidentally drop it onto the floor, maybe I’ll be brave and serve it for the first time at the party. Mary’s Baking Service is back in business!

stopdrinking,"The Daily Check-In for Monday, March 6th: Just for today, I am NOT drinking!","*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Thank you everyone for sharing yesterday, checking in, and for your words of encouragement! I appreciate each and every one of you ❤️ so today I want to talk about gratitude! Something the old timers at AA around here groan about when they’re sharing about their early days is gratitude lists lol, apparently that was the go to solution all their sponsors gave them to anything. But personally I love taking the time to be grateful. I remember one share that stuck with me early on from someone, who said that when he was drinking, he’d be depressed and feel bad about life. But once he’d been sober for awhile, he realized that at the end of the day, he honestly did have a pretty good life when he was sober and could actually show up for it. Life has its ups and downs, even sober. In fact I’d say especially sober, as you’re living life on life’s terms. It’s easy to get caught up in the lows and the grind of things. One of the many things I love about the guys over on the IRC chat is every now and then someone will ask everyone to list a few things they’re grateful for. If you feel like it, how about sharing 3 things you’re grateful for today? I recommend listening to “Always look on the bright side of life” from “The Life of Brian” while you do so, which has been stuck in my head through the writing of this lol 😅 I’ll end this with my 3; 
* my family, I have a wonderful, supportive husband, a few beautiful (in my very biased opinion) kids and what some would say is “too many cats” 
* My new(ish) speaker, I’ve been listening to so much more music, podcasts, audiobooks, etc since getting sober. One of many things that’s made my life feel a little bit richer then when I was drinking!
* This sub, the IRC Chat, and the people I’ve met through AA. You guys have all been my sober community and I could never do this without you all ❤️

Hope everyone has a wonderful Monday and IWNDWYT! :D",2023-03-06 05:04:42,1678079082

stopdrinking,Can someone tell me what sleep is? It’s something I rarely/never do without booze.,"On a serious note though. I have been quitting drinking and other medication for 7 days now. My sleep is non existent. Its to the point that I have to take a zopiclone, melatonin, magnesium and a benedryl to knock me out. I hate doing it, but there is nothing that will even make me remotely tired. I also have gotten a prescription of clonazepam and have been using those. Still not much help. I find when I do that all this stuff my sleep can either be very good, with very vivid happy dreams or a complete nightmare with me being put in scary limbos and seeing things throughout the night.

A little back story. Since covid I started drinking every single day. I would use stimulants to keep the party going and I did this for about 2 years now. Last year I went through a nasty breakup and thats when I started using heavy concoctions of sleeping pills to knock me out to sleep.

So now im back at work and it’s just exhausting. I don’t know if I should try and quit everything cold turkey and just be sleeping from 2am to 6am each night and hope that it gets better or keep taking the sleeping aids. I find the sleeping aid’s I am building up a resistance too and I hate hate hate being on them.

My question is is how long does this usually last? What would you do if you were in my shoes? Also has anyone else had this problem? 

I found that last week when I had 6 white claws and a few shots I would sleep like a baby. I know I can’t buy alcohol and pace myself every night with a shot because sooner or later it will just get out of hand. Im so lost on what to do and it’s driving me mad.",2023-03-06 04:57:42,1678078662

Then an annoying thing with door dash happened and i veered off into a shitty state of mind. Annoyed that I was so annoyed by the food thing then got me dreading work tomorrow. So I complained and bitched and said sorry I know I’m being an asshole about things. 

My boyfriend has got to be sick of me by now because I know I am. I hate this negative, selfish, self righteous asshole I am right now. There’s no excuse for it. I’m trying to change my thinking, but not hard enough.

Lucily chest pain and alcohol withdrawals get you right in,  no waiting.  Hospital staff are all angels.  The compassion they had for me was unbelievable and helpfull.

After they made sure i wasnt having a heart attack.  They started me on meds and made me super comfortable.  They admitted me and made me stay the night.  They checked on me nonstop to make sure i was okay.  I got home today and had to have a couple hard discussions.  But i am truely done now.

stopdrinking,AA didn't embrace me properly but I'm still not drinking,"I was going to presential meetings for a month in a AA group around here. It was awesome at the beginning, but then it became too overwhelming. I never used weed before a meeting and never talked about it. But I started listening many people saying how they hate weed, because they associate it with the heavy drugs they were using when they were drinking heavily, including alcohol. For me it's the opposite. If I use weed, it makes less sense to drink. Some people started noticing I was hiding something, because some of them talked about it at their turns: ""dont hide anything from us"". Or even worse: ""dont lie to us"". I never lied. I always said: ""I'm x days without alcohol"". Anyway, I naturally decreased about 70% of my weed (cannabis oil) consumption and im still not drinking. But I decided to stop going to AA meetings. I live in a very conservative country (Brazil), and I started getting the feeling that I had to go there to defend myself from suspicion of other members, instead of talking about alcohol. I really think it's none of their business if I use cannabis oil somedays. Many of them take benzos and other medications. I bet if I used a similar speech about those pills, they would get the same feeling I get when they talk about weed. I was thinking that maybe it's part of my alcoholic personality. I get resentful and angry easily, and to avoid more problems, I walk away. And for now, I really cant go back. There is a risk that I will speak aggressively if they criticize me because of weed.

I could probably go on with these issues but I've had enough and started with today being day 1. I know I have enough discipline to do it and I can't wait to see the differences I can make.

stopdrinking,Business Trips &amp; Sobriety,"Hello greatest corner on the internet! I’ve just got into town for a team offsite and this is my first business trip in my life that I’m planning to not drink. 

In the past, these adventures started at the airport. Where it’s like Vegas and socially acceptable to drink at any hour of the day. I LOVED airports for this reason. I successfully got through the airport and was pleasantly surprised how minimal the trigger was to when I was in an airport 3 weeks ago. Success on getting through trigger #1. 

While I’m excited to prove to myself I can get through the additional triggers like hotels and social activities, I just can’t imagine what the new way of travel is like.

stopdrinking,"Holy crap that was close. Made it through, though.","There's a mindfulness coping skill called 'ride the wave' or something like that. Basically you acknowledge the craving then ride it out. It works for me because I know that the craving will pass sooner than later, and by acknowledging the craving I can keep myself from dropping into autopilot mode. Autopilot was the main cause of slips and eventual relapse.

I have a box full of one-year coins from my local AA as evidence of my autopiloting skills lol.

Anyway today started out good: a decent night sleep, awake around 5:15am, and up around 7am to finish deep cleaning the kitchen. Finished up around 9am and my kiddo texted from her mom's house asking when we're going to Home Depot. We settled on 11am and I went and fixed some breakfast.

Kiddo and I went to Home Depot, got a few things to finally finish my DIY kitchen remodel, returned home, and I was inspired to tidy up this small shed out back so I can move some lesser used things out from the garage. So I do that, now the shed is all clean and ready to receive stuff.

This puts it around 4:30pm today. Sun was still up and a little warm outside. I hadn't had a cigarette all day (one a day!). I had accomplished quite a bit. The craving to drink hit *hard*. Harder than in recent memory. The local grocery store is four minutes away, it's $9.78 for a pint of vodka, a liter of soda water, and a small juice. It felt easy, natural, and perfectly reasonable to bebop to the store. And I realized I was on autopilot.

My friends... Holy shit. I stood there in my yard talking myself out of and back into drinking, over and over for like 15 minutes. Eventually I remembered to ride the wave, that I did NOT *have* to drink, and that in a few minutes the craving will pass.

And it did, and I'm sober now at 6:54pm. IWNDWYT.

stopdrinking,Why we do,"Why trudge the road of happy destiny or whatever we call it? and work out? I got my answer this weekend

&amp;#x200B;

On saturday my wife and I were awoken to my 14 year old son running around the hosue at 6am disoriented unintelligible and half dressed, which is very unlike him. He is very high functioning autistic and doesnt have a huge social circle, and he presented as one of those dudes on cops who went out and did drugs, very unlike him, but i call the situation as i see it. it was kind of like a crazy dude on a cops video (but non violent, just out of it). We were able to get him into a hospital where he went into a seizure and was just completely bananas for the next 12 hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

24 hours later he is doing well, after tox screen came back there were no street drugs which was the easy answer, but between fever, strep, and he took what we believe is a half dose of childrens benadryl, (posion control shows benadryl in his system and he said he took one) he had extreme low phosphorus and, none of those things should have been causal in itself but, yeah

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, in the hospital he is very hard to manaage, not being bad but just brain and body not working together and out of it. at one point last night when reorientating him in bed, he extended his legs and was basically standing on the bed not aware of what he was doing. So i'm 5'9 and 190, he is 6' and 170 and strong, and it took 100% of my strength to keep him safe, fully extended holding him up. After we got him back down it was better. my body was exhausted and my back sore.

&amp;#x200B;

But heres the thing i think about. If i were drinking, and drank friday night, i would have been way too hungover to help the next day. if my wife wouldnt have been there i would have chocked it up as being high and let him sleep it off even though he wasnt sleeping.... I wouldnt have been able to go to the hospital, or even help. And if i hadnt done the stupid exercises i do over time, (i dont lift all the time, but exercise and do power lifts at intervals to ensure i dont get hurt when i'm 70). I sat there after with my slightly sore back (sore like after lifting, not like after an injury)

&amp;#x200B;

The point is, The things we do matter. at some point in your life you will need to adult up whether it is for yourself or someone else, maybe your child. You can't be there if your drunk. If i were still drinking i would have been probably hungover, and definately not strong. and if i hadnt taken care of myself in sobriety and exercised , i either myself or my son could have a good injury (possibly both). 

&amp;#x200B;

I dont exercise just to look good (i'm not, like, photo worthy lol), I do it so that i can be there in reality when needed, and not get injured in the course of life in the real world.

It does matter. Take care of yourself. Take care of your back and legs. Life happens.",2023-03-06 01:15:18,1678065318
stopdrinking,9 months clean. Before and after,"https://imgur.com/a/SHYHrpC

I drank and used drugs for about 15 years. 

Substances made me feel more comfortable in my own skin. I didn’t believe that was ever possible. So I vowed to always use. But it quickly came with problems, because of my behavior. 

I isolated myself. Was always angry at someone or something. I didn’t take care of myself. I could barely do anything, even getting out of bed. Couldn’t hold a job. Gone to jail multiple times Eventually , I was so reckless, I was close to going to back to jail or dying. Everything seemed fine on the surface, but I was in danger of myself. 

I went to some meetings through the years. Some by force, others when I was broke. Something inside me thought “the only way I’ll be able to get through this is if I go to a meeting.” I hated them, but when I was able to use again, part of me felt l was doing the wrong thing, even though using still felt like the only option. 

I got tired of living the way I was; an empty shell of a person, just miserable and alone. Flash forward to now: this has been the best 9 months of my life, by far.

Im glad I kept photos of myself in active addiction. I thought I looked good! LOL. I feel so much better now. I still have my struggles, but ya know, one day at a time.

How do you folks in recovery get through the 4:30ish to 10 PM period? 

I find this whole time of day to be torture as a recovering addict, especially Sundays. I’m a mom, and when I was drinking Sunday evening was a pleasure because I’d cook a leisurely, delicious family dinner with a few glasses (or a bottle) of wine. Then it’s bath and bedtime for my LO and prepping for the work week. 

All of these activities (particularly cooking) seem unbelievably dull and depressing now that I’ve stopped drinking. I’m so bummed I can’t cook half of my favourite Italian/Spanish recipes because they all have wine or sherry. Chasing around a toddler before bath time is an exercise in frustration now that I don’t have alcohol to smooth out the process. Then I just end up staying up way too late feeling like I’m going to either jump out if my skin or crying into a pile of laundry because I feel like I’ll never feel joy again and feeling guilty for finding normal parenting activities so utterly dull. 

Quitting as a parent is HARD, guys.

So much about child-rearing is all about routine and lack of novelty. I love my kid. I need to stay sober for him. But the parenting grind without any chemical assistance just feels so tedious and frustrating.

I knew all the facts, triggers (or so I thought) and had “time” under my belt. I had survived college homecoming, holidays, reversed the physical symptoms and proudly told everyone that “I don’t drink”. 

Calling myself an alcoholic seemed wrong when I “conquered” that already. So, I charged right back into the woods because I wasn’t an alcoholic just a girl who HAD an issue before *cue eye roll*. It took lying, hiding and convoluted shenanigans to keep it under wraps. At first it made me feel in control to have just one drink with no one knowing until I realized the alcohol won that round of sobriety. I’ve come to realize that there cannot and will not be any slack on viewing myself as an alcoholic because that’s the only true reason I don’t, can’t and won’t drink. being referred to as an alcoholic seemed limiting but now i see that when I don’t think I’m an alcoholic, all it does is allow alcohol to reintroduce itself to me. 

No, it doesn’t define me as a person but it does define the connection I have with alcohol if I were to drink. I will not listen, negotiate or compensate with alcohol again.

I kicked him out of my home, and cut all contact.  


Flash forward a year later, I met my current partner. He too has had deep problems with alcohol, and was currently living a sober life. That thrilled me, finding someone who intimately understood the things I had gone through (including a physically abusive partner) although we had connected deeply on many other topics before alcohol came up. We’ve been together over a year, and have already overcame many other obstacles that would have broken other couples, all non-alcohol related.  


However, less than two months ago we both wanted to attempt moderation, see if we could drink again, together. And it was fine, for a while. We set boundaries, only two drinks, which slide to a few more than that. No shots turned into two shots, sometimes more. Occasional breakfast beers creeped in. And still we were fine, and thought “hey we got this!” each time we had fun.  


Last Saturday my partner had his last day on a job he hated, and we decided to celebrate at the bar. We had three shots each, went home, danced in the kitchen, had mind blowing sex, and talked for hours about very deeply personal things, got very vulnerable. I woke up alone to him on the couch, and instinctually felt I’d done something wrong. It wasn’t til that afternoon after work we discussed what happened. He’d revealed something deeply personal that had nothing to do with us, or me, but a prejudice he’d had before meeting me that I personally felt insulted by. We argued verbally, he said “fuck you!” to me and had slept on the couch. I had no memory of this.  


I instantly felt sick, and afraid. This, this was something we both promised each other we would never do, I’ve never felt anything but love towards my partner, and only wanted to make him happy. We talked through it, and both agreed liquor doesn’t serve us; it only brought out that ugly, viscous demon made out of abuse, anger, hate, hurt.  


We already had plans for dinner with our mutual friends/couple that night, ending with some fire spinning (my friend and I are fire performers) so I already had planned on minimal drinking, but we both felt it was time to pull back hard.  


All was going well, then a close friend of all of us asked if she could come over too, watch my friend and I play; of course, I love to show off!  
But she brought a grocery bag full of Jell-O shots.  


And my partner and I fucked up. With a few beers under our belts, neither of us said no, we cheers-ed, and we drank. A lot. I stopped at a hard buzz, I’m not proud how much I let myself drink because fire safety is so important!! “Spin sober” is our mantra, but it’s a guideline not a rule. Know yourself, know your limits. However, my partner really let himself loose, and once the jello shots were gone, our friend and him disappeared to her house, then came back with a bottle of vodka.  


After this, I only have flashes. After we finished spinning fire, I had a few shots, talked by the fire pit, then put myself to bed, around three in the morning.  


I remember laying down, mostly asleep with that black boozy buzz. Then all the sudden I was standing, my partner and I yelling at each other. Screaming. We pushed each other, then all of the sudden we were in a full blown fist fight. Looking back now, I know we both triggered each other into fully disassociating, all my memories are chunky, either terrifyingly clear, or black blurs, flashes of red/light, sounds or physical feelings.  


I remember being pinned on the ground by my throat, trying to hit his face, kicking him off because his arms were too long. I remember locking him out of the bedroom, only for him to kick it in while I tried to hold it shut, crying for him to stop. I ran down the hall and up the stairs, but that room doesn’t have a lock and he pushed right in. I remember laughing at him while he choked me, egging him on to “try fucking harder to kill me.” At one point he had me pinned in a hold and wouldn’t let go; I bit him, he hit me but wouldn’t let go. I bit again, harder til I felt his skin tear. He let go then. Somehow I got my phone and hid outside, I called friends until someone picked up.  


I got ahold of a coworker just after 5 in the morning, thankfully she lives close and drove right over. I climbed into her truck and we talked, at some point my partner climbed into his car and sat in that  til my friend climbed into his car and talked to him. He drove off, I went inside alone and had a meltdown. We’d trashed the bedroom, he’d kicked in that door, we’d trashed our art room. I was so deeply ashamed, scared, angry and hurt.  


I cried myself to sleep, then reached out to my friends who’d been at my house the night before, and my best friend. Everyone was shocked, and rightly so. My partner and I have always tried our best to be above all kind and patient with each other; we both went through nearly the exact same experiences and would never wish that upon anyone else, especially each other. I felt like a failure.  


My small chosen family rallied together and made me dinner, and had a long, enlightening discussion. We all share similar traumas and triggers, tragically common in the LGBTQ community. I was given a lot of good advice from different perspectives. I ultimately decided I needed time alone to sort myself out before figuring out how best to sort this mess out with my partner. We cohabit-ate, but he moved in with me and I am solely on the lease.  


I spent Valentine’s Day alone, taking hot bathes trying to soothe my aching body. I was mostly still in shock I think, I watched lots of kids movies, I recall lots of processing emotions.  


 Yesterday I reached out to my partner and set some hard lines. Our first in person meeting is Saturday with a mediator. Depending on that outcome, we will sort out new living arrangements. I am in no way trying to paint myself as the victim, I was an active instigator and enabler in all this. I’m deeply embarrassed at my weakness, allowing my ego to get the better of me, the arrogance of believing I could control my addiction, shame of the dark hateful person that hides within me. I’m angry I let myself down, even angrier I let my partner down, I hate I wasn’t strong enough to stand firm even when I saw the signs; I blatantly ignored it all. There’s no going back and fixing this, it’s too late our path is forever altered. I can only move forward mindfully and try to make amends. I love my partner very much, and I’m so ashamed of myself. I never meant to hurt anyone, we both only meant to have some fun. I am incapable of removing that association of pain and trauma from alcohol. I am responsible for my well-being, and that means keeping alcohol away. Starting yesterday, today and from now on, I do not drink!""

Since I wrote this, a lot has happened.  My partner and I met with a mutual friend as a moderator, and had a very deep and insightful conversation.  We both shared a lot of the same thoughts and fears, and were able to fill in the gaps more clearly of that night.  My partner moved into a separate bedroom in our house while we talked through goals, boundaries and gave each other time to heal.  We're doing so much better now, focusing on developing healthy habits independently and I feel we have been so much more successful at communicating difficult thoughts and feelings with each other. 

 I’m so grateful this community exists, your experiences and wisdom shared inspire  me to keep trudging.  IWNDWYTD.",2023-03-05 23:04:56,1678057496
stopdrinking,4 days in....must keep busy....,"I had surgery on Thursday morning, so I was fairly out of it that day, and was in too much pain (even with medication) to do much Friday, although I spent all day updating my food tracking app, researching recipes, planning out the next month's of meals, Saturday I spent 13 hours deep cleaning most of my bedroom and getting boxes and boxes of shit together to donate (my apartment got into pretty bad shape with the past 4 years of binge drinking every day), and so far today, I've spent 6 hours meal prepping for the next week. My back is in agony, so I'm taking a small break, but I've got more to do that'll hopefully get me through the rest of the day.


It's helping, but there are so many times that the urge hits me like all the wind has been knocked out of me. 
Friday night, I started sobbing, and while I could say it was dumb online frustrations, I know it was because I wanted a drink so fucking bad. I even admitted how badly I wanted one when my best friend called to see how I was doing after surgery. I've never admitted my drinking problem to him,  but I'm pretty sure he knows. He said he was proud of me and I started crying again. 


Trying to focus on the positive....my apartment is starting to look better, I've lost 5lbs in 4 days, I'm not laying in bed for hours after waking up on the weekends....hell, this is my first sober weekend in about 4 years.


But I'm so scared of downtime and having my brain use that time to remind me how good it feels (in the moment) to be drunk. 


Anyway,  I've been reading this sub for a while in anticipation of having to quit and I'm so grateful it, and all of you are here.

stopdrinking,I'm honestly afraid to stop,"I stopped drinking in January and made daily posts here for a couple days and I literally thought I was dying. It was the most painful and difficult experience I ever had. I was hearing voices, starving, and just absolutely gripped with fear. But I got through it. Now six days ago I decided to drink for one night. I talked my self into thinking I could stop. But I haven't stopped drinking since I started, I have to drink to consume food and I never feel good, just not terrible if I've drank enough after waking up. I'm drunk right now and I know it's not always welcomed to come to these forums when drinking. I'm sorry about that.  

But I want to stop. But I can't work up the will to go through that again. I am weak right now. I know a lot of people will tell me to go to the hospital and to be blunt, I refuse. I'm embarrassed to admit to my wife that is gotten that bad again, I have no insurance, and on a very fixed budget. Neither me nor my wife work and we live out in the middle of no where we are  mostly off grid. (I got starlink internet but no running water or sewage (I handle that legally though, long story) so it's even harder to get super sick from withdraws or hang over because I already rough it with little comforts  but the point is I'm far out in the mountains and I'm not used to going to cities or anywhere that has hospitals or doctors. To get to one would be a journey. 

What can I do? I try to taper off but I just get drunk and not even convinced that works. I want to stop so bad but I can't go through this again. That line sounds slightly suicidal and I promise I'm not and would tell my wife if it got like that. I just want to be free of the  nightmare but I feel trapped.",2023-03-05 22:44:21,1678056261

It's felt.... easy? Well this last month I've had a run for my money the cravings have been ridiculous etc. Well last night I went to an NHL game with my kids. Everyone knows how in your face alcohol is at a sporting event. Well I managed to escape my kids for a bit (they were with friends and are old enough lest anyone cry negelect!) and was alone with the opportunity and desire to drink.  And I'm pleased to admit I made it out unscathed with an even stronger commitment to my sobriety.

stopdrinking,Why bother?,"I've been sober for almost two weeks. I've been sober in the past and have even gone months without even thinking of a drink years ago. I went through the most ridiculously painful period of my life when my partner of 11 years just left me last July. I don't know why and he won't give me a reason. I didn't drink for two months and went to survival mode. Then i slowly started drinking again.

It got bad (for me) over the winter break as i was all alone. My roommate moved out early and my flight to see my folks was cancelled (Southwest fiasco). I decided to be very serious about getting sober when my stomach hurt from drinking the night before that i missed a class. 

My deletion from the winter break made me not do any work in January for my last semester of my masters program. Missing this class was my last break from my professor and i can't miss anymore. I knew i needed to stop completely so i can just finish.

Well like many of your stories here i got bad news. My parents aren't coming to see my grad show and they had sworn to me they'd be here. They originally told me don't worry about it they'd be here and they just told me on Wednesday that it's too expensive and they can't come. They can't come for my graduation either. I just want to show them my studio and at work. They've never visited me anywhere i lived since I moved out at 20. 

I tried reaching out to my ex but he continues to ignore me. I don't have any friends i can leave on and i lost about three due to how much support i needed it when the breakup first happened. 

I wanted to stop drinking for my health, mental health, and future. But now i feel completely alone. I stupidly started to believe i could rely on my folks and my heart is broken. I'm so scared at the prospect of moving to another city for a job and being alone. My ex knew he was my family and support. I don't have anyone and i was working on that before he left.

I'm sitting in my apartment wondering why I'm even staying sober when no one will care if i hurt myself. Why should I try to get healthy for a future alone? I don't have any more strength to just keep going and keep toughing it out.

stopdrinking,What to do for a friend that has fallen back off the wagon?,"As I was writing this I realized that I already knew the answer to the question, so this is more of a statement. Some back story:


Last year, almost 3ish months into my sobriety, I finally admitted to my church that I had a problem, and that I was about to celebrate 3 months sober.

After the service, one of our sound engineer guys (older than me by a good number of years) approached me and asked how I did it, because he had a problem as well and didn't know what to do.

Long story short, I've been helping him as a sobriety buddy as we've gone along, and I thought he was doing well. He would tell me he's been going to AA, and we talk about things pretty regularly, about both of us. His wife and him had separated about 6 months ago, she needed space to figure things out as well, (he was very emotionally abuse when he was drinking, and she'd already stayed with him through his 15 year opoid addiction prior to the drinking starting). It was rough, but he said he was pressing on and working on himself, learning to be a better partner. 

Today, I found out that hes had been drinking again for a while, and had managed to get an aggravated DWI about 3 weeks ago. Any semblance of trust is gone, I've asked many times how he was doing, was he staying sober, and he'd always reply yes. He messaged me today saying he wouldn't be able to make the rehearsal for Sunday (I lead the praise band) because he's not sure where hes going to live and doesn't have a license anymore. He hasn't called me or messaged me back for several weeks up till now when I asked if he was still set for rehearsal. 

He may be giving up, but Im not giving up on him. Don't give up on your friend that may be falling back into patterns. Don't give up on yourself. They may have hit a stumbling block, but that doesn't mean it's the end of the journey. Tell them to pick themselves back up, and keep going, no matter what.

Yes, some  some bells may have been rung that can't be un-rung. Falling hurts, and you don't always come up clean. Pick yourself up and keep going. No matter what.

Tell them that. Don't let them give up on themselves.

Or if it's you thats fallen, same message.

Pick yourself back up and keep going.

stopdrinking,second aggravated dui,3 days ago I got my second aggravated dui on almost the 4th anniversary of my first. I blew 3 times the legal limit. Last one I had I rolled my car 4 times and that still wasn't enough to stop me. I stopped drinking all together and am starting to feel a little bit clear headed. Just sleep is hard and I keep shitting my brains out. But I just lost my shit. I was realizing I needed to stop because my ex got cps called on her and they started harassing me. I already suffer from depression so I managed to get 2 days without it before another cps meeting where they said they were gonna hair follicle test me and I did Coke new years so I'm pretty sure I had some sort of mental breakdown because I just went out and drove around town in circles drinking and throwing the beers out the window until I was swerving enough a cop took notice and pulled me over. I'm usually very careful even if I have been drinking and decide to drive I would set cruise control and drive straight back home from wherever I was drinking so I didn't get caught again for 4 years. But that night I really think I was trying to kill myself without directly doing it. That's what happened with my first one too I literally drove around town all day into the night downing whiskey and beer until I went off the road and crashed and fucked my back up pretty good for the rest of my life and that was the other lowest point of my life where I just said fuck it I don't care what happens. But now I'm on supervised visits with my daughter so I made things 1000 times worse than before and dug a giant hole for myself. Me and my dad were rebuilding our relationship and I was putting back really good money as a delivery driver so I lost my job  and my dad hasn't said shit too me since. But for the first time in my life I'm fucking horrified to drink. I think this is what I needed in some fucked up way. I mean I can't have anyone threatening to take my daughter away. When I got out of jail I hugged her and almost cried because I fucking failed her I just didn't want to breakdown infront of my family. But at first when I woke up in jail I just wanted to be dead and I felt nothing but embarrassment and shame. But now that I'm on day 4 of no drinking since the dui I'm starting to really feel motivated to get the jail time over with and go to AA. And pay off the mountain of fines I'm going to get. I'm anxious to get it started I feel like my old life ended that night in a way and I can finally be who I've always wanted to be for my daughter now and the fact that I'm going to probably to be doing weekends in jail and doing loads of court appointed classes plus paying a fucking shitton of money out is starting to not burn so much because I honestly think once I'm done with all this I'll look forward and never want to go back. I just wish I could of had this attitude sooner but maybe this was just fate and while I was drinking and in that mindset I couldn't see anything but the shitty road I was on through the beer goggles. Idek why im putting this on here other than to rant but this is the first time I have had real hope since I started drinking  that I'd ever be able to change and get my head out of my ass. And my daughter deserves her fucking dad not some belligerent fucker who drinks to the point he is subconsciously trying to kill himself instead of working on my depression sobering up and trying to change. I just wish my dad would understand that I wasn't and still probably am not fully in my right mind and that I really have some serious mental health issues I've been ignoring and drinking to the point that everything became pointless. But all I can do now is get therapy and work on myself. But I really do think I'm finally ready to pick up the pieces and be what I always could of been without alcohol.,2023-03-05 21:07:13,1678050433

The bar hopping was last night and when I got there I felt some anxiety. I felt out of place around all the new people and wanted to drink to solve those feelings. But I took a breather outside with my fiancé and when I came back in I got into the groove of the evening and had the best time, sober!

Im currently at my lowest point right now with the states I’ve been in because of drinking. I think this is the hardest thing I’ll ever have to do and talking to my family and friends is going to be the worst part. No one has a clue I’ve got a problem so It’s gonna come as a bit of a surprise.

I never thought I was a compulsive person but after reflecting on the amount of times I’ve lost control and let my self fall again and again, it’s pretty clear. And thinking back to how my older brother is when it comes to drinking and how similar we are. we just can’t stop, and betting blackout drunk is a guarantee for me if I go out.

I’m sick of the guilt and fear when I wake up every Saturday morning. I’m not an alcoholic by any means but when I do it’s always a binge.

I know what I have to do going forward. I lost my phone and wallet this weekend and that’s not even the worst of it over the past 4 years. I’m currently 22 and I know my life will never be the way I always wanted it to be, but I have to believe it’s still worth making the decision to go sober. I’ve tried in the past to just drink less but I know I don’t have it in me, if I don’t want to destroy my life this is what I need to do. I have lots of hobbies and passions but I relise now I’ve long since given them up without even realising.Truth is, I’m going to loose loads of friends, but I’ve accepted that and in reality I’ve lost a load of friends purely because of my drinking.

I know I’m not in the worst state I could possibly be in, but if I don’t start now, I know I’ll lead to my own personal destruction in the next few years.

Wish me luck and good luck to anyone else starting there journey.",2023-03-05 20:34:40,1678048480

I'm more than aware of the harm I'm causing my body and mind and have reached the point where I truly do want to quit. 

I am just trying to figure out how to do this safely. I've been a pretty heavy drinker for almost 4 years. Anywhere from 6-12 beers in a day and also cocktails if I'm at dinner or at a party. 

I feel like it's a lot. I'm 5'7"" at 175lbs if that matters any.

What is your guy's opinion on seizure potential in this scenario?

I feel like quitting cold turkey would be the best option realistically. I can't ween off. If I drink one beer even, than you can count on it that I will figure out a way to have 6 more.

Are there any other immediate health concerns I should be worried about? 

Maybe I'm overthinking it in an attempt to procrastinate actually committing to this. It's a really hard thing as all of you know.

I’d say 10 large cans of beer a day. Maybe more. I live with my father, haven’t had a real job in months, and basically spend my days drinking and feeling sorry for myself. Recently it’s gotten very bad, I’m barely eating, chain smoking, no exercise, bad sleep etc. And I feel it. I feel like a ghost, a hologram made of anxiety. Sobriety is obviously an undebatable necessity at this point. I don’t want this to get worse than it already is. Anyway a good friend of mine who is a chef offered me a job as a prep cook in his restaurant. I’ve just had my second trial day. It’s a nice environment, the staff are super friendly, boss etc all good. But I just don’t know if I’m psychologically capable of handling 12 hour shifts in a restaurant at this point. I can’t even hold a knife to chop potatoes without shaking like a leaf for fucks sake. Just don’t know what to do. Should I be honest with him and tell him that I need a week to sweat this shit out of my system? Should I just white knuckle it and keep going?  Should I say screw it and just take a few weeks/months to concentrate on getting sober? Eating sleeping gym etc? My dad is financially well off and could definitely support any effort in that direction. They seem satisfied enough with me so far, and that’s why I’m in a pickle now. They want me full time more or less but I feel like I’m constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdown. My shrink even says I’m on edge of needing to go to rehab. I don’t know what to do. I need structure and self esteem, and money of course, and a job could do that for me. But I also accept that I am physically addicted to alcohol at this point and ending that takes absolute priority. My mental health is in the gutter and this needs to end.

DO NOT. 

DO NOT CALL YOUR LOVED ONES IF YOU'RE DRINKING.

My aunt called me at 5am and woke me up to ""Check up on me."" She was clearly drunk and confrontational. I only answered because I thought there was an emergency, only to hear a bunch of self-assured ""I'm here to help."" rhetoric. Shes the only one who knows what its like to quit in my close family. I love her to death, but for the love of God if you're going to drink PLEASE don't call people ""Just to talk"" while you're drunk. She ended up mentioning that my other Aunt thought my vape was causing my mental issues (I've been kinda manic the past month)  and I started laughing hysterically because my whole family smokes Cigarettes, so of course they think vapes are some new dangerous thing.  She ended up getting mad that I laughed and said she was putting the phone on the bed, so I just hung up. She continued to spam call me until I said ""enough is enough"" and went to sleep after turning my phone off. Ended up missing an important phone call from the hospital that was scheduled to give me surgery, and now they're not in the office till Monday (the day of my surgery) so I now have no idea what is going on. 

TLDR: Don't call your close relatives while you're drunk, you might just cost them an appointment they waited years (yes years) for because you kept pestering them.",2023-03-05 19:59:20,1678046360

Now that I am clean, I feel like I am accumulating sober days so slowly. Its probably because now I am finally awake and have so much extra free time. It feels like reaching day 30 is taking forever.

stopdrinking,My wardrobe smells like paint thinners,"So I follow my nose, while trying not to puke in my mouth. Mm I know that smell. Vodka no doubt. So I open the doors, no obvious signs of the old debris that comes from daily drinking. Puzzling. 
  

I swear to myself ""surely I got rid of all the bottles, I'm pretty sure, 95% sure, definitely sure there are no bottles left in this room"" I did the purge last time my room had descended into that nest of depression. Well this time is the total purge, I'm moving in too short a time. 
 
 
I start to pull out long forgotten clothes which seem suspiciously heavy, bags that have lived in the bottom of my wardrobe since it's creation. Suddenly I realise where the smell is coming from, as I have a vague memory from one of a hundred blackouts. Did I REALLY stuff vodka bottles in every pocket of every thing in here?! Could I actually have forgotten this many bottles?

My boyfriend has been sent to rehab. His family held an intervention and he ONLY went to rehab because i told him he had to go or i won’t move in. 

He started heavily drinking a few months ago because he lost his job and felt lost. he ended up getting arrested for hitting me in public so he has court stress over his head as well. 

i am suppose to move in and i am not going to drink while he’s spending his time there and am going to make sure to do what i need to do when he’s back. but is it even a good idea that i move in? i am so scared he’s going to get back into his old habits after coming back. but i do believe rehab will help him find better coping mechanisms and advice. 

besides our arguments and fights while we drank. things together are great. i don’t want to break up ):

Long story short my mom died when I was 15 and my dad got really really depressed. Alcohol has been an escape ever since. Even worse it's been a reward. A reward I've been too keen to give every time I needed it.

To help me out I've decided to tell everyone that I'm gonna stop. Next weekend. So now everyone knows my intends and I'm horrified. I'm not sure if I can do this. But it feels great trying.

stopdrinking,Thoughts on how it's going so far,"Every time I've quit/paused drinking before, it's felt like a battle. Like I still really *wanted* to do it, but I was making myself abstain.  This time it feels different. Like I am finally fucking ready to get off the stupid ride that is excessive drinking. 

I turned down TWO invitations to have drinks this week AND I did it because I truly was putting myself first in that moment.  Both the turning down &amp; putting myself first are new. Old me would have gone for drinks ""just because"", or because I felt so desperate to be liked/included that I'd go along with it because I'm starved for human contact.  

 New me is Like ""no, I need to go to BED"".  And I genuinely like the way I feel better without alcohol. I look at my chubby body and wonder how much of my extra weight is from alcohol (or the excess calories I consume after drinking?)  Hard to tell after 35 years of drinking but I finally feel like I'm ready to find out.  I recently heard that phrase 'protect your peace' and am figuring out that sobriety is part of that, and that it all relates back to self love (of which I don't have a lot but lord I am trying to get there).  That I have no peace if I'm constantly doing the chaotic dance of drink/hangover/shame/drink again.  It only took me until age 49 but I really hope that I am learning what I need to learn to finally let this shitty habit go &amp; finally give myself the self-love and regard that will enable me to make truly respectful choices for myself going forward.  

Anyway, this time feels different.",2023-03-05 17:57:56,1678039076

How is this ok? The amount of fights we’ve had where he’s blamed my drinking for things  and saying I am an alcoholic but he can do whatever now that I’ve stopped? Because the last huge fight we got in and I almost poured a drink he told me he would leave me.

stopdrinking,A fundraiser last night.,"So last night I went to a fundraiser with my wife.  I had a lot of anxiety because this was a situation (open bar) I would normally drink pretty heavily at. I was preparing mentally, reading all your great posts on ways to get through this type of social situation. 

We walk in and the host says: right there in the middle is a non-alcoholic bar, in back is the alcohol bar. I was shocked! Literally a fully stocked bar with all non alcoholic spirits, mixers, wine, beer…everything! I could order any drink I wanted. Oh boy did I hit up the non alcoholic bar over and over. 

What was odd (but great), it felt like my days of drinking. Holding a cocktail that tasted and looked like a cocktail. Going back to the bar over and over. It was great. My wife, who does a ton of hiking, was stoked too. She had a big hike today and didn’t really want to drink last night. 

My take away…this needs to be Normalized at all social events. Have a NA bar! There was usually a line and the event only had 60 people at it. I just wanted to share with all you fine folks. 

For those interested the company providing this bar was named Boisson. I have no affiliation to them, just really excited about what they are doing. They have a shop here in LA but ship all over the country. Mods-if this isn’t allowed, pls let me know I’ll remove. 

It was a great night. It ended with me and my wife feeling great, saying how much fun we had. I didn’t drink. I’ve found so much help here, I just wanted to thank you all. Iwndwyt",2023-03-05 17:37:34,1678037854

Woke up today, a bit off.I was soon hit by a sudden feeling of extreme sadness mixed with a bit of nervousness. As the day went by those feelings got stronger so I decided to try sleep them off. 

Woke up after 2 hours feeling extremely ill. Wanted to throw up, headache, shivering and more. I was a bit comfused but I said ok am just getting the flu but then it got more weird. Suddenly as I was laying in bed accepting my faith it all went away! Now am feeling like nothing ever happened. 0 symptoms. 100% healthy.

 Am just trying to understand what happened. I ussualy get sick suddenly when I do but never in my life that came and went like that. Anybody who experienced something simillar? It may got nothing to do with it but I got to wonder if cutting off alcohol is related.

Well I did it- I had those 2 beers and called it Good! *maybe I can drink responsibly *, I thought to myself. 

Fast forward to last night - my parents asked if I wanted to get a drink for evening happy hour. I figured sure, I can drink responsibly and limit myself! 2 beers, no more. 

Well 2 turned to 3.... then to 4 and then 5..  I got home and slept awful. Just sweating, fast heart rate, etc. 

I was disappointed with myself. I thought to myself how it's not fair some people can drink a beer and call it good. Why can't I be that person? Feels like I'll always just be that person who can't stop at a drink or two.  So I guess I'll have to just not have any. It was a good lesson that I can't be one of those who can drink and stop whenever.  When I had a beer. I just wanted another, then another, then another.

stopdrinking,Please help. Do I have a drinking problem? I need to know... and I do not know. Or maybe I do know.,"Let me preface this by saying I don't drink daily. 

However, for most of my adult life, when I go out I can't seem to stop once I start, and I get absolutely slaughtered. I can't count the amount of times I've gotten drunk to the point of not knowing my own name. 

It got better for a while. Then it got bad again. My husband and I are very social people. I thought I'd calm down when we had our daughter 3 years ago, but apparently not. 

She has never seen me drunk. 

Yesterday we went out with friends to a radio station's music festival. Our daughter went to my parents. 

I knew I wasn't supposed to drink. Because I am on anti depressants. 

I ended up getting absolutely slaughtered. I had about five panic attacks and fell asleep on the air mattress we had set up for our group. 

I also cut my face terribly because the umbrella broke (long story) but I can't remember this happening. 

I slipped and fell off a (low off the ground) garden bridge on our way out. I also can't remember that. My husband is adamant I didn't hit my head so that's at least good. 

I've been carried out of bars because I was too drunk to walk. I've stood upright and fallen because my legs have given out from under me. 

My plan is to stop drinking while I'm on medication. But now I'm starting to think I'm going to stop in its entirety.",2023-03-05 16:50:23,1678035023

I'd just wind up back at the bottle. I definitely am super wary about dating other people in the same AA group as me. I have seen some drama go down already and that isn't even with people who are dating people I know, sometimes they're just hooking up with people from different AA meetings I don't go to. I'd have to really like someone and they'd have to have good sober time for me to really consider going out with them.

stopdrinking,Stopped drinking for dry February and kept going…I finally feel good in this moment.,"I quit drinking for dry February and, for some reason, decided just to keep going for now. I often stop for one month out of the year, but I haven’t done it in a while. This year I simply didn’t *want* to start drinking again. 

In the last month, I have read a lot of other posts about the challenges many others have faced. I have probably written and deleted close to 10 rage posts on this sub myself about how utterly bored, tired, and hopeless I was feeling every single second of the day. Most days, I was impatient, exhausted, and felt physically ill. I got nose bleeds twice, which for me isn’t unheard of but still uncommon. I was honestly getting concerned there might be something more serious going on.

In any case, today, I’m sitting at my desk that I sit in every day for hours on my computer when, for some reason, I feel a sense of peace I haven’t felt in the past month. It reminds me of a calm version of a runner’s high. Things seem clearer, and life doesn’t feel like a means to an end. I’m not sure if or how long it will last, but it feels nice.

I don't know if this piost will help someone stay sober another day, but I won't delete it in hopes someone frustrated and feeling defeated by the process might find it helpful. There is light at the end of the tunnel.",2023-03-05 16:38:32,1678034312

But I also have some concerns about this. I'm worried about the social pressure and my friends' reaction, because I'm so young and I want to stop drinking. It's not like they are only friends because of drinking or something, my friends are more than that, but still, we are young and they liek to go out as a main activity.

stopdrinking,69 days - what a journey,"First post here.  69 days under my belt and man what a journey it’s been.  This group has been very helpful for me so hoping to offer a little bit back and hope it helps others.  39 year old believer, husband, and father of three (15,12,10)

Certainly I’ve seen improvements in physical and mental health - although this season of healing is taking longer than I would have guessed.  Glad not to have debilitating hangovers and anxiety but anxiety still lingers.  Dealing with some TMJ and hoping that will resolve.  Continuing with sleep being mediocre, and energy levels being up and down - post acute withdrawal I think 

When you quit you expect things will only improve - the experience can be somewhat paradoxical.  For instance, my marriage got way worse before it started showing signs of healing.  Two very difficult months on this front where I had to come in contact with the idea that I may have thrown away my marriage as a consequence of my drinking.  Pretty despairing but happy to report we are on a good path. 

Life is very heavy - which is one of the reasons I believe we drink in the first place.  For many years (decades) it allowed me to escape reality.  Now I spend much of my time confronting existential questions about life, purpose, reality - a spiritual experience to be sure.  Very rich and rewarding but not exactly easy or relaxing. 

I’m not in AA although I may go one day.  I started seeing a counselor which has been very helpful.  Also I have a few friends who quit drinking and have been able to provide good counsel along the way.  

It’s not that long ago at this point that I was drinking daily.  I remember always battling attempts to moderate, and thinking ‘I’ll quit tomorrow’ maybe a million times.  Point being I always thought I was about to either make a change or improve my relationship with alcohol.  Meanwhile my kids were getting older and I’m almost 40. 10-15 years passed very quickly.  Now in sober retrospect I have a surprising thought: this was way worse than I thought.  All kinds of memories are coming up that I now look at with disbelief.  What a disease. 

By the grace of god if feel like I’ve gotten a second chance at life. 

I’ve let go of the concept of regret on the notion that somehow Gods work exists in the good and bad.  god uses our trials to both test and improve our faith.  That right there is good news.

I drink hard liquor every single day and I have for about a decade.....a fact that I hadn't even realized until I just typed it. I'm a successful accountant with 2 preteen daughters, a CSA survivor, a DV survivor, and a raging alcoholic. It runs in my family. For context, I drink every night beginning the moment I walk in the door after work and until I go to sleep. I went through a several months time period of also drinking before work and even sneaking sips of cinnamon whiskey during the work day in my office.

If tasked with say running to the store for a grocery item, I'll likely stop for a couple of minis during the trip if given the opportunity. It's bad. And the worst is I don't think anyone can tell I've been drinking during these 'not at night openly drinking at home' times....resulting in my alcoholic justification of such. So my reason for this post is to ask for help to actually take a real step to stop. I told my dr a half-assed story about fearing that my alcohol consumption may increase due to mounting pressures at work and home with growing preteens testing my patience.

Since then, it has continued to escalate with the stress of the pandemic and came to a tipping point in September 2022. 

After a particularly bad full weekend blackout binge, I woke up to a note from my husband saying he couldn't do this anymore and he was afraid that my drinking would end our marriage. Holy shit.

I started reading books about alcohol, going to therapy, joined this sub, but I didn't stop drinking - I just slowed down. During this time there were a few nasty binges but a lot better than what had been going on before. 

This year we both decided to try Dry January and liked it so much we did Dry February. Last night my husband's cousin got married. Since we already did 40 days, I thought I'd be ok to drink. We went out with the family and had a pre-wedding beer. And then a shot. And then after the wedding it was an open bar. So another beer. And another beer. 

At this point I had forgotten I had offered to drive but it was too late. My husband, disappointed, said we'll both just stop and he'll drive. Perfect! My addict brain then came up with a genius plan: I would just 'go to the bathroom' and grab a beer on the way and slam it before getting back to the table. At one point, I had the bartender get me a glass of wine and I just drank the entire thing RIGHT THERE like an animal. 

I missed the first dance, my SIL noticed how drunk I was and let my husband know. We ended up leaving early, like we had planned, but now instead of a nice evening together I was shit faced and crashed out on the couch. 

I know I embarrassed him in front of his family. I know my 'i am so sorry's' sound hollow. And I know I'm going to spend an entire day hungover. I need to do better. I know I can do better but this addiction is wicked. 

So here I am. Sad, embarrassed and hungover.

Stopped myself from getting a quick pastry because I knew I could eat something healthy at home. Enjoyed the fresh air and some sunshine. Came home to chill before heading to a hot yoga class, which has become the highlight of my Sunday mornings. 

I came across a tik tok of a guy describing his hangover after a night out and the memories hit me. All of those mornings I spent stuck in bed or curled over the toilet. Blinds pulled down because the sun hurt my eyes. Ordering greasy food delivery because that was all I could manage. Afraid to open my phone and see what texts or called I had drunkenly made. Anxious because I assumed someone was mad at me. Whole weekend days wasted because my hangover took over.

stopdrinking,24 hours AF,"Marylander. My goals are to increase my AF days and reduce during A days. Not been successful so far. Actually worse. Two high alcohol content IPAs daily turned into 3 or 4 daily. Been a bad two weeks. Lots of stress from my daughter who at 23 is not maturing. Stressing also because I have not been able so far to drink less. Worried alcohol now controls me. Weight blew back up because of all the calories and drinking leads to bad food choices. On Friday we went to our friends to celebrate her first grandchild. It was small gathering at her sister's house. They have a beautiful house on the water and turned their upstairs into a party room. Full stocked bar/fridges lined with beers/ and everybody brings food. I probably drank 8 IPAs in 2.5 hours. My wife drove us home. On Saturday I felt like garbage so my wife went to our grandchild's soccer game. Knowing I need changes, soon as she left, I drank my last two IPAs (9 percent alcohol content). Drank the last sip of the second at 9am. A little buzzed I got up and started to clean up. Once I felt sober I packed all of garbage and recycles into my jeep to take to the transfer station. The recycle bin told the story of this mass of empty IPA beer cans from just one week. It's like ""Did I really drink this much""? Only good news is no vodka bottle. I have been sneaking some vodka and cranberry into my Yeti rambler I use for ice water to hide my drinking from my wife. I stopped doing that a couple of weeks ago when the massive Absolute bottle finally was empty (4th bottle I downed in 2023). Have not replaced it and no plans to do it.  I managed to do all my chores and shopping on Saturday so Sunday's plan is to do the exercise bike for an hour and then take my real bike for a ride on the base I work at which has a beautiful stretch for several miles along the Chesapeake Bay.  


Goals this week:  
\- No IPAs/No vodka  
\- More AF days than A days  
\- If I have an A day, limit two low cal/low alcohol content  
\- Go into office three days (I have the option of going into work or working from home. I think going in the office works better for me.)  
\- Exercise everyday (exercise bikes-running-lifting)

My update: I had a stressful week at work. I also had therapy. I’ve mentioned to my therapist in the past that I find myself emotionally eating in moments of high stress and the first time we talked about it and it would likely work itself out in therapy- but it hasn’t quite all the way. So, she has agreed to explore it a bit and give me some resources! I am excited about that. I also started working out at my friends gym, it’s a weight training gym/box gym. I wanted to see how I liked it before I mentioned it, but as it turns out I don’t hate working out I just hate cardio and I am loving weight training. So my routine has been 15 mins of cardio 45-60 mins of weights, 4 times a week. Still doing the yoga studio once a week too. I have more energy lately, and by default I want to eat better after putting in all that work.

I drove too fast and hit the curb in a turn and almost lost control of the car. Luckily nothing else happened and I only have some minor damage to the rim of one wheel, but I have become painfully aware (again) that alcohol and me is NOT a match and this could have gone much, much worse.

stopdrinking,I didn’t drink today but lizard brain absolutely took over for a while and that scares me,I’m at day 10 and Saturday nights are huge triggers for me. I’m a 2-3-maybe4 x a week heavy binge drinker. It absolutely destroys my next 2-3 days of hangover and anxiety. So Saturday nights I usually drink. I purposefully picked up a shift at work to work past when liquor stores are open. Drunk me goes downtown easily but sober me will never. However tonight while at work and knowing this I felt so much like drinking that going out was worth it since it’s my only option. I didn’t notice my brain being in a completely different state until it was over. I’m a little scared how persuasive this voice was and I so ungodly badly wanted to drink tonight. Does that insane almost animalistic urge go away after a while? Honestly if I wasn’t trying so ducking hard to stay sober I absolutely would’ve drank tonihht.,2023-03-05 07:28:41,1678001321

stopdrinking,made it thru a Friday + sat night in nyc.,"Friday I stayed in and ordered food and watched tv. 

Saturday I had two plans with two really close friends.  

I had some not so great sleep Friday night but Saturday I woke up and decided to walk and get a croissant. Drinking made me so restrictive with my FOOD diet but since I’m not getting alcohol calories, I’m letting myself enjoy basic shit. Despite being tired I felt mentally clear which was pleasant for a Saturday morning usually spent hungover and ordering Uber eats 2x day because I’m too violently hungover to walk 2 blocks to Whole Foods…

I then met hi with a bff I only get to see every other month or so and we went to a brewery — I had an NA beer and honestly it was really pleasant. I felt giddy catching up with my friend and I smoked a bit before. I love a Hazy IPA so much. And the NA really helped quench that desire. 

Then I went to go see another bff for her bday dinner. My craving for the red wine was insane. I love being at an Italian restaurant and having that first sip of wine with burrata and prosciutto. Nevertheless, I conquered my desire and didn’t drink. 

Then we went to a comedy show and I had a Diet Coke and that was fabulous. 

But then we went to a cocktail bar and I had sparkling water and another NA beer. That’s when I got really tired — it’s midnight at this point — and I just wanted to go home. But I felt like a party pooper with others drinking. 

Fast forward it’s 2am and I’m in the Uber home. I’m exhausted but I made it through the night without drinking. 

And tbh I had fun. I was just as chatty as I usually am when I’m drinking. The biggest difference is that I actually felt present in my conversation — when I’m drinking it’s just me and my drink and I typically feel very withdrawn inside even when I’m having a conversation with others all I’m drinking, so this was a nice change. I just hope that I can have this willpower every time I go out. It’s really hard to stay out late at night when you’re not drinking lol. And doing blow. 

Anyways, this is just a stream of consciousness to help me process one of the first times that I’ve gone out and not had a drink in about six years of living in NYC.

stopdrinking,Coming up on 100 days,"And I feel more and more distant towards alcohol. In the beginning it felt like letting go of my best friend. My security blanket. My comfort and my peace. It felt weird but I new it was no good for me and I was going down a slippery slope. 

Now, all I can remember is waking up at 3 am with dry mouth and anxiety. Wondering what I said and did last night. 
Who did I text and did I write anything embarrassing? Did I say anything wrong? 

Now, I occasionally get these ‘moments of bliss’ that I never really experienced before. Where I feel completely calm and truly happy with life. Grateful even, about what I have (family, house, job) and where I am (far from wars and criminality). I feel less aggravation towards things in general. 

And I never ever have to drink again. I made it through Christmas and new years without even wanting to take a sip. I have found many great drinks not containing alcohol (tonic water with a dash of lime feels just as ‘luxurious’ as G&amp;T now). 

The only thing I could say I struggle with is other drinkers. Having to justify ‘not wanting a drink’. If I say ‘no thanks I’m driving’ or ‘I’m on-call’ or something it’s usually fine but not WANTING to drink seems really provocative….

stopdrinking,62 days sober,"I'm 62 days sober. This is my best attempt yet. I've tried numerous times going sober before. I've never made it this far without a single sip. Some days are effortless and some days are very very hard. I hear a small voice tell me a single drink won't hurt no one. Then I have to remind myself it'll hurt myself and everyone who cares about me. 

I've been having a harder and harder time lately because  my mental and emotional well being are so bad. I keep having feelings that I'm a failure. That no one truly cares about me. That I'm annoying and a burden to the people around me. I don't know what's wrong with me. 

Why are my emotions so fucking wild? Why are my senses attacking me in the worst way. Last week I had to leave an hour early from work because I couldn't get a handle on the panic attack I was having. I was sobing like a little girl in the bathroom hyperventilating and afraid. I did everything I could to try and calm down. I just couldn't get a grip.

I think I used alcohol too much to repress all this emotional baggage. And now I have no where for it to go except to come out when I don't want it. I can't go back to drinking and I won't. I'm tired of being a disappointment to everyone around me. I really don't know where to turn to. I guess I need to take serious strides to reaching out to a mental health expert. I don't want to because I'm uninsured in America and such a thing is very expensive. Still I can't keep going it alone. 

I guess I'm just going to have to force myself through. I can make it. I just need to remember the small voice that is attacking me in my mind is incorrect and illogical. I'm not unloved, I'm not hated, people aren't avoiding me, I never cared what anyone thought before why care now? I have people who genuinely care. And I need to keep remembering that.

stopdrinking,I am now the bar show Chad.,"When I was younger, I’d go to local music shows and one of the coolest things I remember is there’d be some badass who’d just walk in during a set, not buy a ticket, not get food or a drink but just chill, like they dropped into a friend’s house.

I went to my first show in like a year. I was nervous it would be awkward because it was at a brewery. I’m also on a diet and they only had fried food. It was a free show so I didn’t want to disrespect the venue, either.

 I decided I was sticking to my diet that allowed me to lose ~25 lbs. and just ordering whatever worked. 

I showed up, watched an awesome set. Fans who wanted to drink were drinking and eating plenty. Plenty of people weren’t drinking because they brought their kids. I joined a group of solo men against the wall, in no one’s way and not bothering anyone. An old tattooed guy who used to play drums in a bad I knew gave me a nod. We are the Society of Just Showed-Up Chads.

I ultimately ordered a soda water thing but I realized it would’ve been totally cool not to even do that. If I felt the need for good karma, I’d write a good Yelp review. You never have to eat or drink anything you don’t want to.",2023-03-05 05:30:41,1677994241
stopdrinking,Sobered up but losing hope for happiness,"After close to 15 years of drinking (and other stuff) almost every day, and wanting to quit but I couldn't, I finally managed to get myself off of it all at the beginning of 2022. I went an entire month dry and was so proud of myself. I got healthier, I had a lot of motivation to be a better version of myself in all aspects of life. I started feeling emotions I hadn't felt in a very long time. I still drank a few here and there, sometimes maybe still too much, but usually felt bad about myself after and wouldn't make a daily habit of it like before. We're talking 3-6 drinks once a month on average. I still felt in control because I could easily just go weeks without a drop and not care, the continuous need to drink was gone. So you could say I've been ""mostly"" sober all of 2022, and I've made a new goal for myself of being totally sober for the entirety of 2023 (which I think will lead me to continue full sobriety into the future). So I am currently 81 days officially sober and going strong.

I am losing hope in general though, because at the beginning I had a lot of motivation, I felt positive about myself and life. Excited for the future and all the new experiences that awaited me being free of the addiction. I was on a mission. As time goes on however, and especially the last few months, I've found it so hard to find any motivation or inspiration for life. I know there is always a general low period when getting sober because the dopamine has to level back out and that takes time, but it's been over a year now and I feel like it's getting worse not better. It almost feels like I'm sinking back into the mindset I had that always drove me to drink in the first place. I don't know if maybe all the inner demons that I was drowning out for so long are finally surfacing for real. Or maybe it's because I've never been 100% sober for this long of a consecutive period?  Maybe the chemical balance in my brain is all out of whack? I should also mention I've been on some antidepressants since before I started this whole journey.

I still keep up with eating healthy, exercising regularly, taking care of myself. I keep in touch with my few good friends, and I go out and do things. Everything just sort of feels empty and far away, if that even makes sense. I worry sometimes that I'll eventually just give up and start drinking to numb it out again. Has anyone else experienced anything like this after sobriety? Is this maybe another phase that I just need to power through?",2023-03-05 05:24:06,1677993846
stopdrinking,Step 2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.,"Wow, what a powerful step... a step I just learned tonight, the hard way. So today, I woke up 15 days sober, for which I am grateful! I went to 4 AA meetings today, in-person and virtual, and when I got home, I was asked by my friend, who was also celebrating her birthday, to come to her party tonight... I started the night drinking water, and then throughout the night, I began to feel my heart starting to constantly drop (like butterflies or, if you're unlucky like me, a feeling of devastation). I began to feel my urges coming back, and I started to panic... I ran to the bathroom at first, but I could still hear the party somehow getting louder, I began to lose my sight and just as the walls felt like they were closing in, a friend knocked at the door. He was concerned for my well-being and decided to kick me out of the party (for my own good), I called a cab and waited outside in the freezing cold and began to shake, probably, because of both the cold mixed with my anxiety. I literally dropped on one knee and began crying. I've never felt so emotionally and mentally exhausted. But I DID NOT DRINK!! No matter how hard the temptation was, and right then and there, I really felt like my friend was sent there by my higher power. 

Let's just say, if I didn't believe in my higher power before, I really do now.

stopdrinking,276 days. Struggling hard.,"I'm 43. 
I started drinking daily when I was 17. 
I've been sober for 276 days.  
Tonight I finally told my wife that I need to dump all the bottles in the liquor cabinet.
When I decided to stop drinking, I hated booze.
I hated the hangovers, the beer gut, the money spent, the stink, the apathy and the impotence.
Through the rancid bile of detox, I found strength in thinking of the bottles as an enemy I would defeat.
Every day I looked at them and said ""not today"", I got a little more self satisfied.  
Days started to pass when I didn't think of them at all. 
 
Anxiety built nonetheless.

The company I work for is in the process of becoming, in their own parlance, ""Fit and Focused"".
There are so many delightfully euphemistic paths to unemployment.
I've dodged something like 6 rounds of layoffs in my career.
7 years ago, they sent me to work from home after they closed the branch office in my city.
Most of the other 120 employees were let go.  
Impending financial ruin is like a sword of Damocles.  
I expect a cavalcade of relentless cataclysms.  

I went to my doctor and took a leave of absence from work.
The Doc congratulated me on quitting drinking and then admonished me for the poor choice of anxiety medicine.
That was around 6 weeks ago.  
Since then, I've been on an ever increasing dose of Zoloft and trying to practice cognitive behavioral training.  
I started looking for new work, reaching out to my company's Employee Assistance Program for their career counselling service.  
I lost two weeks to Covid, which at least for me was worse than detoxing.  Despite that, I was actually starting to relax.  
I even managed to do a Zoom job interview as I was on the mend. I bombed it by rambling, but was feeling good that I'd got even that far.

I had my doctor fill out the company required medical forms for extending my leave of absence past the 4 week mark. 
He was certain that his diagnosis would ensure an extension.  
When the third party representative who had approved my initial absence for the company had his follow up meeting with me, I told him how I had been progressing.  
He said he'd get back to me soon.

Thursday at 0900 he advised me that my leave is unapproved.  
If I can do I job interview, I am fully capable of working. 
I was back at work by noon, at which point I advised HR, the 3rd party and my boss.  
I was in shock, unable to do anything but sit down and get back to work.    
Any additional hours away would be subject to standard company absence policy - which means termination after 3 unexcused absences.
I'm sure if I'd looked up, I would've seen that sword drop another inch or three.

While I was away, my 20 year company anniversary passed. 
In recognition, a bot emailed me some points which I redeemed for $200 in Amazon gift cards.
For my 10 year, the company director gifted me a Bulova watch engraved with the company logo.
Times change I suppose.

My boss called me shortly after I logged back in.
Not to say welcome back, how are you feeling, congratulations on 20 years or anything so inanely personal.  
It was to advise me that everyone below management level in our organization who isn't bi-lingual has been outsourced.  
The outsourcing company will offer some employees full time contracts, others they will pay to stay on long enough to remotely train their replacements in India.  

I am bi-lingual.  

I swear that sword is close enough to cut my hair.  

I haven't really slept in a couple of days.
I've been restless and shaky.  
I played chugging guitar riffs as fast as I could until my wrists hurt.  
I took 2.5 hours to cook a 30 minute meal.  
I isolated myself in my office to write this rambling diatribe.

I have had a few instances lately that have set off rage (particularly a young woman whose dog keeps trying to attack my dog and when I try to have a reasonable conversation about it, she laughs), this rage sits with me for the whole day and rules me to my core. I have tried working out so hard to try to release it, controlling everything I possibly can with in my power- cleaning, eating healthy… you get the point.

My life is coming together again. 

I wish I could say that it has all been easy, but that would be a lie. There have been many times where something happens to put me in a bad mood and I immediately start craving alcohol. Or like on Friday when I went out with my GF and her sisters to watch a movie and thought about how it would be fun to have a drink before (and a whole lot more after). My GF and I are slowly working through all the harm I caused with my drinking and those conversations are never fun for me and normally I would have just gone to buy booze to forget about it. 

But through all of that, I didn't drink. I would do the difficult thing and then go play a game or read a book or go to the gym. I would actually consider whether the thing that is getting on my nerves is worth getting upset about and whether it is worth throwing away the progress I've made for a few hours of forgetting about all my problems.

stopdrinking,It’s been awhile. Felt like sharing today.,"I’ve been sober now for a little over six months. Before this six months, I drank every. Saturdays were my heaviest drinking days, sometimes starting as early as 8am. 

Quitting was rough. I dealt with a lot of withdrawals and my anxiety was horrific. I’m shocked to look back and see how far I’ve come. I have a picture of me on my day one that I frequently go back and look at. It’s disturbing to see how I looked. Unkept, swollen, my eyes looked empty. 

In the beginning I was here on this sub everyday… sometimes multiple times a day. Lately, I haven’t been on much. Not because I don’t want to be, but because I’m finally out living my life! If it wasn’t for this sub, I wouldn’t be were I am today. 

I spent a lot of my day getting my garden ready. For the last month I’ve been babying veggie starts, and today the day came that I could plant them outside. For three years I’ve been wanting to do this garden but never could because I was too drunk, unmotivated and didn’t have the finances to get the area the way I wanted. Today that dream became a reality thanks to sobriety. It was a beautiful 80F out, birds chirping, music playing in the background… it wasn’t even a sense of happiness I felt, but I was content. I was in the moment, all my sensing present. Last year if I attempted any yard work, I was half drunk and chugging beer because I felt I deserved it. The beautiful weather was a trigger. I used to tell myself there wasn’t anything better than sitting outside with a beer in hand. 

This evening as I was pushing my son on the swing set, solar lights that go around the yard clicking on, I got a complete view of all the work I put into it these past few weeks. The sun was setting and my son was laughing and enjoying being pushed on the swing set and I just couldn’t help but have an overwhelming sense of pride I haven’t felt in a very long time. I’m finally feeling comfortable in my own skin and pushing myself daily to be happy. If I can hold onto those things, I know I can hold onto my sobriety. 

It really is One day at a time. I still have bad days that I want to drink, but i continue to wake up every morning and make the conscious decision not to drink for the day.",2023-03-05 03:38:13,1677987493

stopdrinking,Alcohol used to cope with humanity,"I always knew recovery would be difficult, but I never realized how difficult. This is one cruel world we live in. All the bullying and things that humans do to each other, it's just so heartbreaking. The modern day slavery that exists as Capitalism pays a non-living wage to the people who work for them for years, just to be laid off without a moment's notice. Alcohol really numbed me to the fact that the world is a very cruel place. 

Nature is metal, there is no other way to put it. No wonder ethanol is legal, humanity needs it to numb themselves to how inhumane we are to each other. People drink themselves through epidemics, wars and other negative world events and periods. It's used as a tool by the masses to cope with living on this giant mass we call earth. The mass which is being exploited not to our benefit, but to the benefit of a very few. Being so raw and really interpreting life differently now has changed my outlook for the good. It felt like autopilot was activated before and I was just flying through it all.

I had become uncaring, complacent and had an overall negative outlook on life. I isolated myself due to this outlook, I thought the world was a bad place and I wanted to hide away and drink myself to death. I understand while people get depressed, downtrodden and broken.

So, the second weekend in May straight after a long weekend with a public holiday (sorry Americans - I’m not sure how to translate how many public holidays we get compared to you all), we have Charles III’s coronation. That’s a fairly big thing for many and even for those who’d rather not have royal family, at least a day off from work. Well, not so if you work in a pub it seems. Our Secretary for State has announced she’s going to use her powers to extend pub closing from 11pm to 1am on the 6th as (and I quote): ""The announcement of extended opening hours will help us all to mark this important event.""

I live in a smallish town where the coffee shops close at 6pm sharp (not so the pubs). I think I’m going to ask her can she use her powers to extend their opening times too…

Alcohol takes me further away from myself. 

Back when I was younger, that was the literal ism. To take me away from myself.

But now I’m generally more comfortable in myself, I’m a mother, I’m who I wanted to be, and alcohol… takes me away from that. It’s takes me further away from the person I’ve been trying to be, it takes me away from my healthier self, it takes me away from my better self. 

I want to be my better self, the self that I’ve been cultivating for years. And I need to remember that alcohol inhibits that, I’ll never be my free, full self with it.

I have had no issues when going out for lunch, birthdays, dinners, etc. Every restaurant, bar or brewery pours me an NA option or at the very least soda water. If I do get a mocktail or something I tip a lot. 

One place though, the bartender always said “let me know when you start drinking again!” and other passive aggressive comments. It was one of my partner’s favorite places, but eventually I had to draw the line and just stop going there. 

I didn’t drink for a year, then I started again, “in moderation,” which lasted about 10 months and then failed completely. I bumped into that bartender and during that time and I did have a drink in my hand. He made a big thing and said “omg!!! Look who’s drinking again!!” very loud. At that point I was so frustrated and I let him have it, explaining that he was the ONLY person who wasn’t cool about it. He backpedaled and said it had been a joke. I told him the joke was never funny. He also said that he had been “proud of me.” I told him that was never expressed through his comments. He did apologize. 

I now have once again stopped drinking, 4 months! I still avoid this place. I did have to go in once for a get together, and ordered a soda water. He said “I’m NOT saying ANYTHING!” which still was saying something and making it awkward. I have to go back today for a birthday party. I’m sure it will be weird no matter what I do.

stopdrinking,Hit a wall and I don’t know what to do now.,"I knew this was coming, I just didn’t know when. Five years ago I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. It is painful and throughly exhausting. I don’t suffer with it all the time, it comes and goes. When it comes we call it a flare up. 

I started feeling a little tired and uncomfortable yesterday, but I chalked it up to getting up earlier than usual for work and having a long day. 

Got up this morning at 4am feeling tired still, but optimistic and okay. Did some laundry, took my son to the library, went grocery shopping. Started feeling really tired on the way home from the store. Fast forward 5 hours and I’m feeling like someone is scraping my body off the pavement after getting hit by a dump truck. 

When I was first diagnosed, my doctor prescribed tramadol to take as needed when I was having a bad day with it. It helped a lot. I’m not really into pills and only took them as prescribed and didn’t drink when I took them. 

That doctor moved away. I’ve since had three more doctors. One of them told me I would feel better if I had a full hysterectomy. Um, what?  The other two just prescribed anti-depressants. Needless to say, not a lot of help. So obviously, I’ve been self-medicating through these episodes. 

Now I’m miserable and keep reminding myself that a tumbler of whiskey will ease this bullshit. 

My husband and I both decided to stop drinking together. Since then, I’ve checked in and asked how he’s doing. I’ve sent messages of encouragement. I’ve told him I’m proud of him. I’ve not even received an acknowledgment that I’m going through it too which was fine until now. 

He asked me to come outside to look at a flower bed he had been working on. I did, but I guess I wasn’t enthusiastic enough about it because, miserable. He asks, “what’s wrong with you?”  I told him I was feeling well and the my Fibro is flaring up. He says, “oh. Sorry. Hey can you not start the washer first thing in the morning?”  Like that fast. Without even taking a breath.

stopdrinking,Day 4 - Will be a challenge,"I started Dry March at the start of the month because I’ve known for far too long that I need to quit for at least a month and seriously reevaluate my relationship with alcohol after.  I’m not sure what my intentions will be after this month, but this is the best I could do for now as I know I wouldn’t make it more than a couple days without caving if I tried to quit altogether.  So the first of the month was my Day 1.

There were some cravings the first few days, mostly triggered by stress and habits, but I made it through.  Tonight my dad asked me to come over for dinner.  My dad loves me and tries to be supportive, but he is incredibly overbearing.  Being around him is a major trigger.  And I know he’ll probably have a glass of wine poured for me when I walk in.  

As soon as I tell him I don’t want it, I’ll have to say no and beat around the bush because he and I don’t have serious conversations.  

Then when I get back all stressed out, I’ll have to deal with cleaning, boredom, and the angst of not having anything better to do on a Saturday night.  Ordinarily I’d go right for a handle of vodka (which had I not packed away the other day would already be finished) and make 2-3 very strong mixed drinks while tinkering around and watching TV.  

But I want to stay strong.  I need to prove to myself that I can make it through today and hold that mentality at least through the rest of this month.  On top of that I can’t minimize the gradually detrimental effects that regular drinking was having.  The constant achiness and increasingly worse bloating in my left side is already gone.

stopdrinking,"BC Canadian here. Sorry, first time poster.","Hello, anyone/everyone reading this. I went 4 months sober recently (best I've ever done, so far), with the help of a 6 week treatment, and amazing people I call family, friends, and that includes all of you. 2 weeks ago, I went through a breakup and sought release through ""just one drink"" which we all know is not and never will be one drink (for anyone like me). After a 2 week bender (liquor), I wound up in the hospital, feeling hopeless. But feeling hopeless does not mean there is no hope. I just had to ask for help. It's shocking how little judgment I received from my family and the professionals that helped me. It's amazing how much help there is, if you can find the power to look, or ask, or both.

stopdrinking,I Just resigned from my favorite job due to people smelling alcohol. I've been through this shit before.,"I absolutely posted this on r/alcoholism as well, I feel like this is a bigger community that will get more exposure. 

I need someone to talk to firstof all. 

Alright, this is going to be long because I've been through this shit before and I don't know what to do. I was people's fucking hero for how I battled this shit before. I lost everything and was suicidal, I managed to get myself into Christian based rehab (I'm agnostic) and came out a fucking rockstar.

Slowly, I was drinking more and more. I suffer clinical depression so it doesn't help that I'm also in between housing and barely making ends meet, as it is. I never drank at work, but apparently, I'd come back from my days off and people smelled alcohol on me. I was confronted and given the option of resigning.

I'm such a fucking asshole and I don't know what to do. I've got a little chunk of money but I can't rely on it. I never knew what the fuck I wanted to do with my life, anyway, but I was holding that job until I wasn't.

Haven't had much today, about four, but all I'm doing is sitting here in an extended stay doing nothing but thinking about drinking. I don't know if I respect myself to get the kind of help I did before. I'm neurodivergent and going through a depressive phase. I entered myself into the hospital last time before rehab.

I really don't wanna do this shit again. What do I do?",2023-03-04 22:50:57,1677970257

Strings of weeks and month before. But I don’t believe I know happiness in sobriety. And maybe, maybe that’s what this lesson is. I feel terrified. I feel achingly alone. I feel like I am close to losing my mind. But I also know I have to hold on. I have to save my life. I have to believe that this will pass and the hangover will heal and so will I. I want this.

stopdrinking,Ooof... need to restart the counter but it could have been MUCH worse,"I used to think that analogy of ""once the door is open again, it's really tough to close it"" was corny, but man that is some real shit. 

Went on a biz trip this week and had to do some schmoozing... and being introverted I generally suck at schmoozing, especially in situations with large groups. 

Back in my days in active addiction, I would just pound a couple drinks and all that awkwardness, anxiety, clumsiness, fear, etc would just melt away. It was my easy button. 

Now that I'm not in that mode anymore, I don't have that crutch, and I did not prepare for it. About halfway thru this happy hour I felt like all my conversations were falling flat, I was self-conscious and running out of time to make the connections I needed and I panicked. Went to the bar and got the old standard... vodka soda with 2 limes. Within minutes, I felt like my old self again. It was like I put a mask on and I was somebody else. All my conversations were going exactly the way I wanted them to, made a ton of good connections, and I hit all my goals... save the most important one of course to not fucking drink. 

First thing in the morning the self-loathing and anxiety crept back in. I didn't overdo it so there wasn't any hangover to speak of, but man did I feel shitty about it. I thought, ""what if the deal I needed came from this happy hour? That wasn't even really me, it would be built on a lie."" So I know it worked, but it can't happen again so what do I do? 

I thought first off, I'd try it without. I had a business lunch coming up that day, and I would make it happen sans poison. Nope. Fell flat on my face. Didn't make it happen, blew a big opportunity. 

Of course then my demon was back telling me ""you don't have what it takes without a little help"" and that made my mind spiral even further down. 

I managed to make it home, but this morning has been tough and I almost... ALMOST went to the poison shop around the corner. Literally had the $20 in my pocket really to go and thankfully I pinged a buddy of mine who has been helping me through this and pulled me back. But man, that was a close call. I know where that train goes, how long it takes to get there and what it takes for me to stop it and I do NOT want one shitty night to put me back on it. 

The point stands tho, I spent so many years propping up my social situation with a chemical crutch that I'm no good at it anymore... maybe I was never meant to me. Who knows... anyways it's a big part of my professional life and I need to figure out how to do what I need to do without it. It's an old story, I know, but it's where I'm at. Gotta restart the counter...",2023-03-04 22:37:05,1677969425
stopdrinking,The difference a year can make,"Last year I got very sick and decided some things needed to change; drinking was at the top of that list. After almost 20 years I cut alcohol out completely and started watching my sodium intake. The left is 28 days after my last drink. On the right is 406 days later, at 37 weeks pregnant (something my husband and I were about to give up on!)
It’s amazing how much better I felt after for weeks, let alone just over a year later. My skin is better, I sleep more soundly, my memory is so much sharper, and my anxiety is almost nonexistent. It’s not always easy, by any means, but it is 100% worth the effort. I used to drink just to sleep and dread the mornings, and now I can wake up feeling human and with the energy and desire to get out of bed.

stopdrinking,Two full weeks,"It has been 14 days so far. Two weeks. Given my usual pattern (binge, feel intense guilt, abstain for a few weeks) this isn't especially remarkable for me. But better than nothing, 

The good - sleep! Though somehow I still feel incredibly exhausted after multiple 8 hour nights. I am also getting back into my old and relatively intense training routine. Heavy squat day yesterday, cycling for approx. 750 cals today. Bench day tomorrow. Very satisfying to mark a completed workout in journal. 

The bad - I feel incredibly foggy. Started the new season of the Mandalorian and I am beyond lost. Likely not a sure sign of dementia but... I tend to be a hypochondriac.  Likely more than a few blackouts between the end of last season and this one. Between that an continuing (and, frustratingly, expanding) guilt, the mental side of things is still very much mediocre. But I'll say this - I have absolutely, positively no desire to drink. Hopefully I feel the same way next weekend!

Drinking was pretty out of control in my teens and twenties. I'm now 37. While I've slowed down, I still am stuck in the cycle. Feel like I can't truly express myself / break through a veil / reset my brain unless I have a drunken night. 

I have successfully been putting more and more days between the drinking—This last stretch was 3.5 weeks. During this time I felt great. Very inspired.

I've not gone 2 months without drinking since I was 15.

Today is one of the worst hangovers of my life, and one of the worst days of my life. And the muse that had joined me has disappeared. Hopefully it returns tomorrow and on.

I've had a terrible headache for three days. I haven't had a headache (other than a twinge here or there) since I had Covid in 2020. I've tried Advil, caffeine, tons of water, laying down, a shoulder/neck massage, hot packs, cold packs, a sinus flush... nothing can touch it.

My husband and I intended to take a break from alcohol together. His plan was two weeks, mine was four. I felt so good about my decision that I decided to see how long I can make this lifestyle last. This weekend he is back to drinking.

Now that I’ve decided to make sobriety from alcohol a forever thing I’m finding that everything feels so much worse. I’m exhausted, I’m unfocused, uncomfortable in my skin and irate. I’m sweaty and sore and my face itches. I feel like a caged animal.

If I had no idea how to clean my car, I’d go to a car wash, where all the tools are and you can see other peoples techniques. Then I can maintain my car at home. Buy soap, a brush, a hose, a bucket, towels, etc so I can clean my car on my own. And I can even clean my boyfriends car just because I can and I want to be helpful and useful to others. And I can do this whenever it gets a little dirty, it’s needs maintenance to stay clean. 

It reminded me of sobriety. 

When I first got sober, I went to rehab. I needed to be shown how to do this sober thing. And after that, I went to AA, did the steps and gained tools to help me live a sober happy life. I sponsored a couple women and used the tools to stay sober and help other women stay sober. Going to meetings helps maintain my sobriety, like a spiritual tune up. I kept going back. Until I decided I didn’t need to anymore 🤦🏻‍♀️ 

My relapse 1 week ago made me realize I wasn’t maintaining sobriety mentally and spiritually. I wasn’t doing the work and using the tools to stay happy, joyous, and free. 

Anyway, I’m glad I took the time to wash me and my boyfriends cars in the beautiful sunshine today. Looking forward to a meeting tonight.

[My Brother's Passing](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/vhia5a/i_lost_my_favorite_person/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Long story short, my (25F) brother (23) passed away suddenly from an accidental overdose. I haven't been able to recover much these past 9 months and I've been deep into my addiction. I struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life and used alcohol to cope but my brother was my first real loss so it sent me deeper. 

I came back home from out-of-state to be with my family and I intended to move back with my boyfriend (lets call him Bob) after a few months. I struggled to make plans though since I was depressed and Bob was toxic and was giving me ""get over it"" vibes. Fast forward 4 months, I get a text from one of his friends asking me how I'm doing. Fine, I guess. (Not really) This friend stopped talking to Bob because Bob was extremely toxic and mean. 

Now you're wondering why didn't I leave Bob? The gist was that I was stuck in an abusive cycle with a narcissist. Anyways, said friend and I start texting and getting to know each other. I tried getting him to rekindle his relationship with Bob and in a moment of weakness while drinking, I opened up about how Bob was treating me. It was then that the friend told me Bob cheated on me 3 years prior. Completely heartbroken, I broke up with Bob a month later and moved out of that house we had together in January. 

I've been trying to piece myself together since then and cut back on drinking substantially considering I went from drinking a bottle a day to 4 seltzers at night. I told myself NO HARD LIQUOR and I stuck with it for about a month....then Valentine's rolled around and I bought myself a handle of vodka that sent me into a spiral. Anyways, I got tired of my shit and somehow I have 5 days (California) sober. I tried the cutting back, I tried the weaning off. I just don't want to do it anymore. If this is how long I have right now, I'm happy because the last time I was sober was 6 days in August when I got COVID.

Here's some background info that will explain why I am so nervous:

Back in December my aunt threw a Christmas party and there was A LOT of alcohol there. I was one of two completely sober people at this party and I was prepared to be the DD for my dad and whoever needed a ride that night. Long story short, my dad (an alcoholic) consumed so much alcohol that he went unconscious and unresponsive. This sent me into an instant panic because I lost my mom unexpectedly when I was 17, and this was due to liver failure we didn't know about, and she was also an alcoholic. I thought I was going to lose my dad. We had to pull my dad off of the couch, take his shirt off and I was prepared to start CPR if needed. We called an ambulance, he went to the ED and everything ended up being fine except his blood alcohol level was like 332? I'm not sure.  


I just hope I don't get triggered by meeting at my aunts house and watching her and my dad drink. That night was super traumatic and I swore I was not going to drink again, but I ended up drinking again after that incident but I am back to sobriety now.

 I just needed to get this off my chest. If anyone reads this, thank you.

We've got a ""no consequences, no questions asked"" policy with the kids in this situation, but it had never been invoked before. My wife and I drove the 45 minutes to where he was, picked him and his friend up, and got them home safely. 

Laying in bed with my wife afterwards, I pointed out to her that if this had happened before I stopped and on a normal Friday night, I would not have been able to have been there for him. But that was then and this is now, and I was there. 

It got me to thinking about the journey, about where I was and who I was then vs now. And it got me thinking a bunch about this sub. There were days in the beginning where reading every post every day was the only thing that kept me on the path. The struggle has faded, but I still read every post, every day. 

I realize that this is a very small story from a guy you'll probably never meet, but the fact that I was able to be there means the world to me.  So from the bottom of my heart, Thank you all. You all are the foundation of my sobriety, and this is the best sub on all of Reddit.",2023-03-04 20:13:13,1677960793
stopdrinking,Feeling Low,"Almost 3 weeks. I fell off around this time last time. Wife still drinking 2ish bottles of chardonnay most nights, and she's leaving the couples therapy books laying around. I need to grow a pair and tell her I only have enough energy to focus on fixing me right now. AND I think working on us is pointless while she's still drinking that much. I don't think she'll ever want to quit...Im not pushing it, but I wish she would. Both of us sober would maybe help a lot of our issues. I came home from a kids softball board meeting Thursday and she was wasted and emotional, and I had to ""work"" from home yesterday because of the weather...I took my girls out all morning today to run errands, but I was even kinda grumpy doing that. Maybe my pink cloud ends around day 16 or 17. I'm done with drinking and drunk partying with friends around my kids. The 7 year old has probably already taken in too much of that lifestyle. Just wanted to vent. I told my wife that I've felt blah the last few days, and she made a comment about maybe I'm not eating enough....SMH. She always talks shit about my eating habits, but it's really because she never feels like cooking shit...so she doesn't eat well unless I cook. Vent over. Thanks",2023-03-04 20:10:38,1677960638

I slipped up and had 4 beers. The night actually went really well for the first 3-4 hours, and not drinking was actually a lot easier than I was expecting. I just quietly sipped my sparkling soda from a cup, and nobody even noticed I wasn’t actually drinking. I didn’t feel much urge to drink, but where the slip up came in, was taking a rip from my buddy’s vape pen. I’ve seen a lot of people say that THC gives them a way to have a little buzz instead of alcohol, but I learned a valuable lesson. For me, all it did was make me feel loose and overconfident, which led to “fuck it, I’ve made it a week, I can have a couple to celebrate”. I think my body will only really tolerate total sobriety, because the weed was definite gateway. I’m disappointed that I slipped up, but I feel pretty positive today despite my actions. I didn’t get crazy, and stopped at 4 because I realized what I was doing. I started pounding water, and I only have a small hangover since I was hydrating so much. I’m super thankful for that decision, because I don’t have the urge to drink in the morning to try to abate the headache and still feeling drunk.

stopdrinking,Questions about Naltrexone,"I've scanned through a lot of your experiences with Naltrexone and they're very informative. I'm hoping that some of you can answer a couple questions though. 

Background: I'm 33(f) drink on average 6-10 drinks a day, consistently. I have done this for years and years, only stopping cold turkey thru pregnancy/breastfeeding and then quickly getting back on track with drinking. That said. I've been prescribed Naltrexone, and I want to start it.  

1) Do I just take it and plan to continue life as usual? Like. I'm currently drinking a leftover vodka soda from last night. Could I, in theory, just take it at the same time? Lol.

2) I don't know that I WANT to stop drinking, but I KNOW I NEED to. Will Naltrexone even help me if I don't ""want"" to? I'm not sure if that makes sense. 

Thanks in advance for any advice. I'm also going to list my other medications below in case anyone has any thoughts on that, although my provider said there were no interactions.

stopdrinking,hearing voices during withdraw,"Sorry long text but i'm really scared.

Hi,

So okay i binged drank a lot but had to stop cold turkey because i went out of money and din't get to buy alcohol, this was on thursday in the morning.

I called my psych at the clinic but they said to just eat well, drink enough water etc, in the afternoon i went to my mom so i didn't have to do this alone, as the night went on i was withdrawing like horrible, like the usual sweating, shaking etc, 
but that morning i started hearing voices, like not just words but full conversations, in the voice of my mom, her bf and my sister, it sounded as if it wasn't in my head, the voices became stronger and stronger and i was so scared, i heard the voice of my mom say that it is all my fault, but not every sentence was bad some where like normal conversations.

But at night the voices became louder and louder and i panicked so hard my mom thought i was in a psychose, she called the hospital but they couldn't help us, so we called crisis care and they gave me sleep medication, but now it is the next day, i'm typing this with head set on with music blasting so the voices sound softer but i'm so fucking scared.
I don't know what to do, the hospital won't pick me up, it feels like i'm going insane. 

I also have hallucinatons but they don't bother me as much as the voices.

Sorry for the long text and the mistakes, typing is hard with the shaking.

stopdrinking,When does the withdrawal get more manageable? Can I care for myself at home?,"Last time I tried to scale back and go 2 weeks without drinking, I was taking naltrexone to curb the cravings but never intended to stop fully. I was throwing up after drinking water, after exercise, after eating, I felt horrible. But I continued to drink after I met my goal and these problems seemed to go away.

It’s two years later and I’m annoyed that my two weeks doesn’t feel doable anymore. The more I read here, the more I’m recognizing it’s not worth it to even have an open end to that goal. I can’t handle it.

However… when does the withdrawal get easier. I feel so sick. My last drink was Wednesday. My stomach lining feels raw and I have to focus on not vomiting any time I drink water, take my meds, eat, etc. I’m shaking pretty violently sometimes, like last night I went to go to the bathroom and was met with full body shakes. Hands always shake but this was like convulsing. I’ve been drinking almost daily since 20, but drinking regularly started at 18.

I guess I’m also asking when to see a doctor. I’m in the US, just started a new job and am uninsured so medically supervised detox that already feels like overkill for me could also put me in even more debt than I’m in. If anyone has recommendations or feedback in this regard, I understand everyone is different, but I’d really appreciate it.",2023-03-04 18:31:49,1677954709

I have recently found myself separated from my wife and family, living for weeks in different places, spiraling out of control.  My drinking has always seemed like a pillar of support for me, because I am not extroverted and I have social anxiety and difficulty connecting with others naturally. In reality drinking is a prison and led to successive poor decisions, one after another. My job and career are dead, my physical and mental health are in shambles, and I took steps to finally end it all this week and was only saved by some coworkers asking for help where I couldn't muster the strength to say why I wouldn't be there to help tomorrow.

I finally got support from mental health workers who gave me a lot of options and things to consider, but one thing they said was that the doctors could not help me if I am not willing to be sober and fix my substance abuse issues.  That was yesterday.

stopdrinking,Getting to 6 months- healing generational trauma,"Hello friends. 

My journey is not ending, but I’m at a good spot to reflect on it so far. 

My family and I have had some productive conversations and reflections. I’m starting to feel like the work I’m doing has deep meaning, and it is resonating around me. 

My mom has gotten into therapy, and so has my sibling. I’m working on my father- but I may just need to accept him for who he is as he is. 

Some of the most productive conversations I’ve had has been with my mom. I guess I feel safest with her which is what has made it easiest. We were reflecting on her childhood and my childhood, comparing notes and considering her mother in the mix. 

She started to blame her mother, and I stopped and said “no, don’t blame the victim. She thought what she was doing was protecting you. At the time that’s the resources women in her position had. If you blame her, I’d have to blame you, but I couldn’t do that. The only difference between you and your mom are that you got out, doesn’t matter if it was 25 years later. You still got out. She lived with her abuser her whole life.” 

I feel honored to have inspired her own journey in growth, and I keep encouraging her to keep doing her work. She is so beautiful. 

I have been tracking my moods and reactions, and in some reactions I wonder, “what memory is being re-enacted in my head?” And I don’t remember. I’m not sure why that particular thing made me feel so unsafe I went into an acute stress response…. But I do. My memory doesn’t serve me. Whether it’s because I blocked it out in childhood or drank it away when I was in the throes of my dependence. 

So I have to reach out to family to help figure out what I’m *actually* freaking out about, and process it. I spent so much time tamping down my true feelings, masking them behind complacency and good behavior, when I would be SCREAMING on the inside feeling I was being treated unfairly. 

Pulling off the duct tape is hard. But I’m doing it. Every day I swallow the lump in my throat and keep speaking, even if I run away and throw up after. 

Here’s to another 6 months, I hope to report back more news of growth.

My spouse was one of the driving forces to help me get clean and continues to love and support me. I’m honestly surprised she stayed after some of the things I had done over our 12 years of marriage when I drank.

Recently I have been getting irritated when she drinks on the weekends in the evening. She doesn’t have a drinking problem, and is capable of being a social drinker. However when I can start to tell she’s pretty buzzed, I get defensive and irritated. 

I don’t have a problem with the temptations with her drinking at this part of recovery, but I really dislike when you can tell she’s flipped a switch and is wine drunk. I’m sure this is what she always thought about me over all those years of drinking so it’s hard to say “you need to stop drinking because of me, even though I put you through hell”

We’re still happily married but this situation seems to be coming up more on weekend.

stopdrinking,I think I was emotionally stunted,"I feel a bit lost lately. I'm a 43f and  I feel like I used drinking for maybe about a decade to feel like somehow it kept my youth. The bars, the concerts, dancing, happy hours, trying new places, new drinks, socializing and all that. 

Slowly that fun turned into nightly solo drinking, terrible sleep, hangxiety the next day and depression. Every morning spent saying I won't drink tonight, and then by noon feeling better and deciding I'll quit a different day. Counting down the hours until my evening drinks.  I was miserable. 

I feel like I was just treading water and coasting in my career, and my marriage and even my relationships with family and friends. Nothing ever really progressed past what I had gained in my twenties. 

So now I feel good and I'm very thankful I quit and I hope to stay quiet but I realized I don't think I ever really grew up. I don't have kids either. I feel like I don't really know who I am or what I want. It took about six months of (mostly) sobriety to get to this point of realization. I can't feel my ""inner self"" or spirituality if that makes sense.",2023-03-04 16:38:15,1677947895
stopdrinking,My magical poker chips (Sunday Solutions?),"It all started simply because I wanted a way to count my alcohol-free days and to have a very tangible and visible reminder of my successes. So I decided to get a poker chip for myself  every day and to then set it on my nightstand before bed as a token of my success for each alcohol-free day. I never realized the magical power I was about to tap into.


These chips are fairly nice, kind of heavy with a solid and smooth feel to the touch. Following several weeks of tapering, on the morning of day 1 of zero alcohol I picked out a poker chip and put it in my pocket. As I grabbed it I thought to myself “I’ll take a black one today; it feels like a good color for strength and stability and calm, like a rock“. 


As day 1 went on I found myself sometimes grabbing the chip in my pocket, squeezing it or rubbing my thumb over its smooth surface. I found it calming, weirdly so. Throughout the day there were many moments where I could feel the stress and anxiety rising and my mind would flash to the thought of getting a drink, but each time I would reach into my pocket and take a few deep breaths while giving the chip in my pocket a squeeze or a little buff e with my thumb, and I could feel the anxiety subside.


At the end of the day I put that first “success” chip on my bedside table. I couldn’t help but smile, and as silly as it sounds I even said a quiet “thank you” to the chip for helping me find some peace and calmness throughout the day. I then slept better than I had in months.


At the beginning of day 2 I was actually excited to go pick out my next chip. I felt a little bit like a kid on Christmas morning. On day 2 I picked a green poker chip and thought to myself “green for vitality, life, and new beginnings”. This day went much like the first, but now I already knew I had a strategy for whenever the stress would rise up or when I would think about having a drink: simply reach in my pocket, grab the chip, and take a few deep breaths. I truly began to believe  that these chips had some sort of magical powers.


Several more days went by like this. Starting each day excited to pick a new chip and to invent some meaning or intention that the color represented for me that day. And feeling pride each evening as I watched my pile of “successes” grow. I felt increasingly thankful to have discovered these magical chips and to be the beneficiary of their power.


Now of course, like with any “crutch”, there will inevitably be moments when you don’t have that crutch to lean on. I freely admit to moments of panic whenever I would realize I didn’t have my chip with me; either I had forgotten it, or left it in my gym locker, or even picked the “wrong color” for that moment, or whatever. That heat-stopping moment of panic accompanied with a thought of “oh no! What do I do?!” But whenever that moment of panic would hit it would just as quickly be followed by the thought of “no, all of this magic was actually of YOUR creation.” The chips were always just a tool, something to focus on while MY OWN BRAIN was the thing that was actually working the magic and casting the spells. So even if I didn’t have the chip with me, or if I had the “wrong” chip, or whatever, the important point is the it has been WITHIN ME ALL ALONG to cast this magic.


So I still go through the ritual of picking a chip out in the morning, although sometimes now I just forget and that’s completely fine and makes me kind of chuckle to myself. And moments can definitely rise up unexpectedly that have me clutching to a chip, even if only in my mind. And without a doubt I feel a great sense of happiness, pride, and also gratitude at seeing my ever growing pile of success that sits on my bedside table.",2023-03-04 16:27:47,1677947267
stopdrinking,Day 6 - longest in a year,"I've been deeply depressed the past few months and unable to think clearly or decide what to do in my life. I've been unable to get out of bed some (most) days, crying my eyes out, wishing for a different existence, mourning my past, dreading the future.. and mustering just enough energy to get through my daily tasks and show face in my social life.

I usually cave in on day four and have a drink because that's when I feel at my worse. It's usually a Wednesday or Thursday. This week, no different. This time, I didn't. I still cried my eyes out all day and was very sick. I have the flu, but I don't know what was withdrawals and what was the cold / flu (negative COVID test) but I really was not well. Migraine, shivering, fever, puking. Crying. I reached out to some friends over the day and that helped some with my mood.. normally day 4 I cave, because I'm in the throws of withdrawals and my mood is unbearable without having at least one.This day I had a neocitran tea and went to bed early.

Day 5
Yesterday, Friday. I ended up having to show my face at a friend's birthday. Most of my friends also drink like I do (i.e. a lot) but I held my resolve and didn't have any. I actually was able to give good advice to my friend in a time of need, despite still dealing with my own issues internally. I was actually sober enough to do so without talking about myself.

Day 6 - today
Today is the longest I've gone in over a year without a drop of alcohol since my nine year relationship ended. I haven't felt like myself in a long time. Today, with my flu subsiding and finally not having my nightly sweats or nightmares, I slept solidly through the night and woke up well rested in a way that I haven't been in a long time. I can catch a glimmer of the real me, one not in the depths of needing a drink, not emotionally distraught, with energy to tackle the day - at 7 am, no less! 

I'm actually starting the day not with a cigarette and a large coffee, but some deep breathing exercises and some herbal tea. 

It's only 6 days but I'm so proud of myself for not drinking. Today I'm going to look into therapy, go for a walk, admit my depression is crippling me to my family, and admit to my friends that I need a break from alcohol. 

I'm tired of feeling bad. I'm tired of living this way. If not drinking can even give me a glimmer out of this depressive hell, then I'm going to fight tooth and nail for it.

I just wanted to share for those like me who haven't managed to get to a week without drinking and offer some hope.

stopdrinking,Liver pain is finally gone,"This has been such a journey for me. 5 months ago my doctor said that my liver labs were back to normal and liver ultrasound was back to normal. She said that I was completely fine. But I still had distinct liver pain almost every day for the last 5 months. But this month, suddenly, the pain is gone. 

I remember about a year ago wondering if I had scoliosis because when I drive I tended to feel like I was leaning to the right. Like the right side of my rib cage was a little heavier, a little tighter. I also thought 1 year ago that this pain was heart related - and I ignored the fact that it was on my right instead of my left lol

I also have a wheat allergy that I’d been ignoring so that could have been causing some of the discomfort.

Anyway I hope I’m done with that, all labs and scans are normal and no more pain!",2023-03-04 16:15:00,1677946500

stopdrinking,Update: Made it 10 days,"Hello everyone! Today I woke up on this beautiful Saturday morning, not hungover but feeling amazing. It’s my 11th day without alcohol, weed, and nicotine.

This post is an update to my previous post on this sub. Long story short, I was drinking everyday, atleast a 12 pack, but upwards to 20 beers on a weekend day. But today is 2 weeks since I decided to quit, and over 10 days without a drink.

It was hard at the start. Luckily I decided to tell people around me about my addiction and they supported me through the first week a lot. The anxiety from the withdrawal was the most intense anxiety I ever felt, this feeling of doom and you are convinced you are beyond saving, that you’ll never feel normal again. My nerves in my body felt like they would just get these intense spasms like they would clench and unclench constantly it is so difficult to explain. My heart would go nuts, it would beat fast, I would get heart palpitations that scared the shit out of me. My blood pressure was insanely high that I would lay and just be thinking if I’m gonna stroke out or something. I couldn’t sleep at all so I would take melatonin every night. It was hell. The crazy thing is I spent the first 4 days or so tapering off which I felt helped a lot! So luckily I didn’t get any of the nasty withdrawals symptoms.

I thought I would start feeling better at day 3 or 4 but after about a week sober I still felt like shit. I would wake up extremely tired. I would go through the day very down and depressed. The evenings felt so boring that I was convinced I would have to fight this urge to drink every evening of my life. The funny thing is, last couple days I feel incredible. I have been sleeping so well, I started getting back into hobbies, my face looks like it lost 5 years in age haha. I’ve been exercising. I got a new spark for life. Yeah I still think about booze but less and less everyday. I feel so happy and so hopeful and my body is actually starting to feel so good.

Thank you for hearing my story, I wish the absolute best for each and every one of you out there. I will not drink with you today.",2023-03-04 16:11:10,1677946270

stopdrinking,One year for me!,"It's been an entire year since I stopped drinking. I went to the ER at around midnight on March 3, 2022, a few days after picking up my partner from the Airport. I had recently lost my grandmother to pancreatic cancer, and by a stroke of fate I ended up with acute pancreatitis likely caused by excessive drinking. I had been slowly increasing my drinking habits over the past several years - I started drinking more regularly after finishing graduate school and sinking into the reality of the drudgery of working an unforgiving desk job - this was in 2016. My drinking was still however largely social, and became more of a hobby than a crutch. However, it became very easy to use as a way to relax after working long hours and commuting long hours. 

I had several stints of sobriety during these earlier years - I'd take long breaks from drinking for months just for health reasons and to test how much I really even liked it or needed it. However, I ended up in a relationship situation that was extremely toxic, which only added to my stress and increased my drinking habits. By 2019, though, I ended the relationship and my relationship with alcohol became much more healthy. I started dating someone new, who also loves drinking, but I drank much less alone and more socially. 

I moved in with my new partner just before COVID hit, and ended up working from home in a small apartment with a lot of people in it. Stress from my job, social life, and the reality of a global pandemic, as well as genearl boredom, led me to drink more and more. I was drinking nearly every day - beer, liquor, whatever. I still excelled in my work and social life, so I never found the need to change my habits. I even hired a personal trainer and was working out every day, going on long walks and runs, and became somewhat healthier during 2020 and 2021.

I moved cities to try something else new with my partner and was thriving in life, but still drinking all the time. We decided to move again in mid-2021 and became depressed with our living situation, leading us to use drinking as a coping mechanism more and more. 

That led me to last year, when my grandmother died. I was depressed, unsure of the future, hated my job, and using drinking as my primary activity. 

My stint in ER, which only lasted a few hours, was enough to scare me to change my habits completely. I cut out alcohol completely, focused heavily on my diet and exercise, and picked up new healthy hobbies. I started running more, rock climbing, weight lifting, and focusing on playing more role play games (this time sober). 

I lost a lot of weight. I went from nearly 200lbs all the way down to 145. I gained some of that back, mostly in muscle, due to regularly weight lifting and rock climbing. I ran three half-marathons. I went from a novice rock climber to intermediate. I changed jobs. I reduced the amount of stress in my life significantly.

I still get stressed out a lot and still miss drinking sometimes, but the quality of my life has improved drastically. I have gone to numerous doctors during the past year as part of my focus on health - i have sustained injuries from sports, and recovered. I have done multiple CT scans, blood work etc. My GI specialist said that my pancreas, liver, gallbladder and everything is completely normal and healthy. It is possible that I may not have sustained life-changing injury as a result of my drinking, and for that I am extremely lucky. My GI thinks that it's also possible that my pancreas issues were genetically linked, and could also be connected to other gastro issues I have since identified and taken steps to resolve.

However I do not have any immediate plans to drink again. I definitely miss aspects of it. It's romantic. It put me in a headspace to be creative in ways that I still struggle with at times. It was, for better or worse, a way that my partner and I bonded together. 

My partner still drinks but much less and is very supportive of me. I honestly feel stronger and healthier than I ever have been. 

No real TLDR here - other than my life is so much better without alcohol. Happy day to everyone!",2023-03-04 15:43:29,1677944609

He says he knows he needs help with his mental health but he doesn't want to stop drinking.

stopdrinking,"113 days and NO benefits, just deep depression, anxiety, fear, isolation","this is not a glum post. it's an acceptance post. I finally decided to quit (just for today) because of a enourmously traumatic break up. I knew that if I drank through those emotions, I'd be dead. (btw, Im 40, no children, was a 'functional alcoholic"" for 15 years. a blackout kind of guy).

for these almost 4 months of sobriety, all I have dealt with are the thousand overwhelming emotions, memories, and feelings (new and old), a clinical depression that was untreated (I took meds that didnt even work for me, I found out after 60 days sober), lots and lots of desperate crying, intrusive thoughts, and have been mostly bed ridden and clueless

and panic attacks, and fear, fear, fear that my life is over etc.

when I was drinking, I worked out, I went to places, I would hook up with a woman easly and get out of the BU rut already. I have my nice bachelor apartmtn (I had to resort to come to live with my parents house)

sometimes I think: why don't I get back on it, the way it was. go out to bars, meet women etc. live by myself, fuck it.

but I won't. I will stick tot the suck. because sometimes there's a glimpse of a connection to myself, to a real, totally unknown me (or maybe the young me, before the trauma and the drinking). I accept its gonna take time, and that there will be lots and lots of dark desperate nights.

I just accept it. (consciously. the disease still tries to convince me otherwise serveral times a day)

I finally can meditate and understand that the post trauma stress that I always had can come and go. I am a survivor of a traumatic childhood. the feeling of dread visits me, but doesnt stay if I face it with compassion. the ruminative thoughts about all my shortcomings (most of them not real) come and go. I knew this intellectually, but didnt have had the ""bottom"" to really put things in practice. because now I KNOW my life depends on it. (what in itself is already a miracle, because I knew I was killing myself in installments with alcohol and didnt care much).

I have to thank people on my AA meetings who told me ""you don't even know what kind of life there is on the other side. it is totally unknown to you. stick with it. you abused for 15+ years. it's gonna take time to heal.""

so, that's it. I will trudge on. one foot at a time. the memories of reading viktor frankl's man in search of meaning are helping me (I wouldnt be able to read the book in my state). but I remember the message. hope comes from love. 

a love for myself that was impossible while drinking. therapy is something totally different now. its so much more intense and challenging, but I feel like something true is happening. 

I always kind of knew these two things, but couldnt creat a self care practice to heal it

My father is in an intensive care unit in a large hospital five hours away from me, heavily sedated and intubated. They have so far ruled out a number of other potential conditions like stroke, head trauma, and so on.  So it is the withdrawal we are dealing with.   

They think his last drink was sometime February 25th or 26th.  He lives alone in an apartment; his neighbor grew concerned after not seeing him for a few days and called for a welfare check.  He was found on the floor, very confused and disoriented, with empty bottles everywhere.  He initially went to the hospital in the small town where he lives, where they had a very difficult time keeping him calm and keeping the shakes and agitation at bay.  I was informed that they were giving him double the usual amount of Ativan and it still wasn't working.  Eventually they sedated him completely, intubated, and airlifted him to the larger hospital.  The current major concern is brain damage.  An MRI showed nothing unusual, but he was not responsible when taken off the sedation briefly yesterday morning.  

The whole family has been concerned about his alcohol intake for 25 years, since my folks got divorced.  My father is retired now, no pets, no responsibilities whatsoever.  I had noticed some cognitive decline over the last several years; chalked it up to the drinking.  I am ashamed to say that up until this past fall I often continued to drink with him when he visited, including asking him to bring wine.  When sunk in my own addiction I couldn't do the responsible thing in this situation any more than in others.  My dad was a former French professor, loved traveling to Europe back when he was capable of doing so, and was one of those alcoholics who thinks they're okay as long as they're drinking wine and cognac and being ""classy.""  Loved to talk about wine, try different ones, etc.  So was I.  I think my father just basically drank continuously, all day, enough to be buzzed and not go into withdrawal.  It's what he did when he visited, and there was wine available.  Once I started trying to get sober and not providing wine, he started drinking my cooking brandy at 11 am.  I didn't say anything at the time.  I had decided years ago that I wasn't worrying about his drinking anymore, since I couldn't do anything about it, and in any case who the hell was I to judge. 

I don't know what the future will hold.  He is alive, and I am thankful for that, but there are still a number of very scary possibilities.  But I am sober, and on day 17,  and the very thought of drinking makes me nauseous.   Since mid-November I had been managing to go on 2 or so week long streaks of sobriety and then would go on a bender for a day or two, but that, while certainly not ideal, is far better than a bender every day for months which had often been the case previously.  Here's hoping this period of sobriety is the final and permanent one.  I will not drink with all of you today.",2023-03-04 14:01:20,1677938480

stopdrinking,"Need some advice regarding intensive therapy or sticking with SMART - meetings. I want to choose the path and tooling that works for me, but my partner is demanding me, setting an ultimatum on joining an intensive therapy track.","Goodmorning Sobernauts,

I was wondering if anyone has some advice on the following.

Almost 3 weeks ago, I hit my rock bottom, and realised that the alcohol intake was progressively getting worse with detrimental consequences. 19 days ago, I started to find ways to work on my sobriety and have done the following:

* Called my old recovery therapist, and asked if they'd have some more intensive track available probs, since I was seeing that it's only downhill from here, and would love to work on staying sober.
* I read This Naked Mind and Alcohol Explained, and these books really opened up my eyes, to see what alcohol really is, what it does to my body, how it will progress when I don't quit, and how important it is to make time to heal my brain and body by not drinking.
* Tried some  AA IRL meetings, but decided that doesn't work for me
* Was advised a secular group by my therapist, and really loved it, so am attending that one once a week.
* Went to Recovery Dharma IRL meeting (as some members of this subreddit recommended me) and this one was really awesome, and I'd like to continue to go there once a week.
* Went to two online SMART sessions, and these especially were VERY VERY helpful. I'm doing the online training now and also bought the book to work on. I want to continue following these two online sessions each week.  


So, in the mean while, I also had another intake at the facility where my therapist is from, and he called me back to tell me that they can offer me this intensive track. This means that I'll be spending 4 weekdays 3 hours in this group. It's the same CBT i got before, individually, once a week, but then in a group. It's IRL and will last for 3 months, with 3 months aftercare (once a week).  


So the issue is this: 

I've not had any cravings last 3 weeks. I'm daily spending time on educating myself, trying out the tools from SMART, reading, posting and checking in here. It's like something clicked. And I guess when you see SMART the first step ' motivation' I guess the big difference now compared to all other quit-attempts is really that I feel very very motivated, and really understand and feel in my core that alcohol does not benefit me anymore at all. There's no hair on my head thinking of picking up a drink.  


I work fulltime, the track would mean a big impact on my time to relax after during the week, would mean I wouldn't be able to attent the meetings (online and in real life) that i've found and in which I really feel they help me. I wouldn't be able to spend any time for the next 3 months on the Tuesday that my stepkids are here (i'd basically only see them once in two weeks in the weekends...) I'd spend quite some money on this track as well, which I honestly don't really have atm, and the contents of the therapy is Cognitive Behavioral tools etc, but i've worked through them before with my therapist, and I feel SMART has many many more tools at hand to discover and implement in my life. Furthermore, I won't be able to complete the whole track, since i'm going on a long trip this summer, and it will only start in 1-2 months time.  


So, my plan of action is: SMART is my therapy, there I can learn tools and connect with people during the meeting to get help using the tools and share experiences. At recovery Dharma I can have an evening of standing still, meditating, meeting people in real life, and at the secular meeting I can have good and deep conversations with people who understand me.  


I'm afraid, my partner will make me go to the intensive therapy, although I feel it has too many downsides, especially compared to the other alternatives I've found. I think he's going to set an ultimatum and so yeah, I'm here, asking for advice or some insight of people who have also been searching for their own path to recovery and how to stay true to one self...  


Thanks if you've made it through this long post, and thanks for all you wonderful people here!

stopdrinking,Hard to not see myself drinking ever,"I want to quit and see the benefits of quitting but also drinking is so ingrained in Australian social culture and with my family and friends, I always think to stop, I do it for 1-2 weeks then I go out and think ""yeah why not have a cheeky few"" which to my credit ill have maybe 4 beers when going out or something but then I just think, well nothing wrong with having some throughout the week. Rinse and repeat. I'm no stranger to addiction, I've struggled with gambling for a few years and I'm on the up and up on that but with drinking although it's not really problematic in a major way to me, I can see that it's not a healthy thing to do consistently and become reliant on it to enjoy the day to day. I love my beer and that's it, I don't drink anything else. When I don't drink the monotony of the day to day and still not enjoying the things I use to like such as drawing, gaming, anime ect that use to give me joy. Maybe its a symptom of the drinking and gambling or maybe it's depression and being cynical with life as I was born with a lung illness so I've always been a little spiteful and angry at life.

Longest i've gone out with drink for over 3 years is maybe 2 months. I've always enjoyed a beer but during covid with lockdowns, my health deteriorating, gambling and genuinely thinking I was gonna die at some point during covid I would say I stepped over a line in terms of what I would consider responsible drinking to problem drinking.",2023-03-04 11:05:20,1677927920

stopdrinking,Can I get a IWNDWYT? - 8 days and going to a party,"Hi!  
First time poster, but found huge support in reading your posts and comments.  
Today I reached 8 days for the third time in 15 years (I'm 30). I've tried just taking a week of off alcohol for the past 2 years but never managed so I figured I probably need more than just a ""break"". I don't know what changed but today I reached 8 days and honestly it's been going pretty well. I feel excited.  
However today is my first day since then where I'll be going out. It's a friends birthday party and it's in a bar. Right now I feel relatively confident about it but I can't shake the unease that I'll be too tempted when I get there or that it will feel like a huge loss to not be drinking.  
I considered not going, but it's important to me that I can manage to attend events and concerts (things I really enjoy) while staying sober. One of my biggest fears in sobriety is isolation and loneliness so I think I would relapse if I started equating sobriety with having to decline friends birthdays.  
I have my partner and a friend (who herself has been in and out of recovery) with me. They're the only ones I've told and there very supportive, so that's a good buffer.

stopdrinking,"Addictive personality, new avenues","I’ve had sleep issues since childhood. They developed into insomnia by my late teens.  Smoking weed helped, for a bit, but after a while it just became part of my daily routine. And if a night ever came when I couldn’t find any weed, I’d lay in bed sleepless and uncomfortable.  For twelve years, I relied on alcohol to hammer me into bed every night. 

In those years, I planned all my meals around how much I expected to drink later at night. I enjoyed food only so far as it could line my stomach to accept more whiskey.  I never ate dessert, knowing I’d be getting all my sugar from a rockless rocks glass before bed. I didn’t even crave sweets then, for the same reason. 

Everyone in my family has addictive personalities. My sister’s never been a drinker, but when I told her I was an alcoholic a couple years ago, she confided in me that she’s always had similar struggles with food. Binge-eating, weight-fluctuation, emotional eating. My older brother’s an alcoholic, but I’m not confident currently he’ll ever recognize it. Depression also runs deep in my family. I grew up with my mom spending entire sunny days off in bed with the curtains closed. My grandma did the same thing. My brother’s been back in that habit recently. 

In my adulthood, I’ve always fought the urge to spend long days in bed. I’ve had issues bordering on body dysmorphia since I can remember. I think that watching the results of these same problems with my family throughout my life caused me to better monitor them in myself.  

Even though I knew they’d disappear after the first drink, I’d get butterflies in my stomach at the thought of my first drink every night. I used to joke to myself that the dull hangovers were the pained twitches of the dying butterflies. 

I quit drinking seventeen months ago, and the two most pleasant rewards for me have been quality sleep and my daily meals. These were ceremonies for me that got so twisted up by alcohol for so long that I’d forgotten they could be enjoyed alone.  I feel the same butterflies now when I wake up and consider closing all the curtains, rustling back into bed for the day. The same butterflies when waiting for dinner to cook, and imagining eating everything in the fridge.  It’s impossible for me to enjoy the perfect amount of anything.

As a 22 y/o male who just finished college coming from a frat I knew I was graduating with a drinking problem, something I've somewhat struggled with since sophomore year. Finally I decided to quit before something terrible happens. I spent the week staying as busy as I could, working my job and (new for me) hitting the gym every day with one of my closest friends who is about to celebrate a year of sobriety. For some reason tonight I slipped and ended up drinking. It's strange because with each sip I feel shameful and angry that I'm letting this past week of sobriety slip away. I say ""for some reason"" because I'm still trying to learn about my use and find out why I drink or what causes me triggers... But alas my determination only feels stronger. I'm excited to wake up tomorrow and immediately continue my journey to sobriety. I think I just need to get involved in AA more and find a sponsor. I've found great success abstaining when I'm constantly doing something whether it be work, lifting, or just hanging out with other sober buds.... Tonight sucks, but I'm not gonna let it ruin my determination. Just makes me realize that I might need more support than I thought and that this really isn't something I can do alone.

Thanks for hearing me out... More or less just wanted to vent and tell someone. But am left with a few questions... Even if you spend the whole day busy doing something productive, how do you shudder away from late night triggers and cravings?

stopdrinking,TMS is helping mg craving??,"I'll start by saying I've never been a heavy drinker but have had major binge drinking problems, and over all alcohol has had such a HUGE power and hold.over me. One sip (almost) always leads to a black out(the times it doesn't always function as the ""good times"" i try to recreate).
I have time and again tried to moderate, gone stone sober for almost two years (a long time considering i am only 24 and did that at 21-22), and have also experimented with no restrictions (somehow this usually leads to the most ""success"" in terms of not over drinking). 

I started TMS treatment two weeks ago for severe OCD and depression. I've noticed a lot of weird little physical changes, like i don't want coffee as much (I'm a huge coffee supporter, especially since it is my alcohol alternative), i was drinking 4-5 cups a day, and within a week I'm drinking only one, by no conscious choice.

More importantly, as i am ready ""the naked mind"" right now, and the book says not to change your habits while you read, i have been allowing myself to drink when i want. This means several times a week if i want to (i am a musician and very often gigs come with free drinks and being expected to partake socially). So i allowed myself this. 
Whe. Usually this would mean getting drunk(only take 2-3 drinks for me) and a severe hangover lasting days, several times a week, it hasn't. At all. Ive had sips, and even a couple (meaning two) glasses of wine this week, but not even gotten buzzed. Everytime it's like i physically do not want it. Consciously i still want it, i want to want it, but I just....don't. i don't buy another drink, i don't try to find someone to buy me one, i just know that i can, but i don't.

I don't know if this is growing up, or the book, or if TMS is actuLly changing my brain chemistry, but i thought I'd share for people looking for unconventional suggestions.

I had lunch with a new friend I met through The Pheonix (sober activities group) and celebrated my two months that was really nice. Pizza and sodas, one of my top 3 favorite meals. Day still kicking ass. 

Then my evening went sour. I tried a new meetup with “social singles” in my city. It was a potluck and bonfire by the bay so it sounded right up my alley. The details said 30’s and 40’s singles, music and karaoke , and (most importantly for me) NO ALCOHOL since it’s not allowed at this park. Well, it was mostly people in their 40’s and 50’s (I’m 38) the music was bad and the people seemingly close to my age were cracking beers and starting to get obnoxious. Only one person talked to me the couple hours I was there. I sat my chair close to the fire to get warm and maybe ten minutes later an older man set his chair right in front of me to talk to a lady he knew and blocked my heat. I was getting cold, had to pee, and feeling uneasy. The whole scene seemed like something my ex would’ve fit in well with so that bugged me out too. I decided to go with my gut and packed up my chair and what was left of the tamales I brought and left. 

I’m glad I was able to set boundaries for myself and leave when I knew I wasn’t having a good time. I’m also glad I tried something new and out of my comfort zone. But I think I’ll keep my new experiences to sober groups and activities for a while.

stopdrinking,Day 5. How to navigate around sober husband who is white-knuckling through sobriety,"To add context, my husband is sober (he was a Jekyll &amp; Hyde kind of drinker). While I too abused alcohol prior to meeting him, in retrospect, it wasn't too unmanageable as it is now. Our relationship was my first inkling into this kind of drinker and as a result I really tried to manage drinking and getting out of it for both of us. Again, I cannot blame him as no one pushed the wine into my mouth but being with him made me a much more prolific drinker.

Fast forward years, he is sober. I am not. I want to quit drinking but every conversation I have with him leads to the same outcome. He believes he will never enjoy his life quite as much without alcohol but is sober because alternative is worse. For  me, this feels very depressing as I really want to learn how to live without alcohol. I also don't think there is room for moderation in our lives esp his and what he is hoping is to one day achieve moderation. I don't think he ever can considering how damaging his personality can get EVEN after two drinks. He changes as a person and becomes almost evil &amp; aggressive to anyone. That and he will go out and pass out on streets etc. He believes it's because he drinks too much hence why he gets that way. Having lived through it, I think he is in denial that even with two drinks, his personality changes. Anyways I don't mean to drone on but even though he is sober and for a while now aside from momentary relapses, I can't share my journey with him. He constantly equates it to his with the disclaimer: yeah yeah I know it's not as bad as his....BUT he 'believes' I drank too much and that's why. He won't accept how much depression has played a role. He won't listen to it. He thinks AA is stupid (okay each to their own) but essentially yes he is sober, but it's because he has no options and life is like living in a grey state now...no highs and no lows. He may be right but why does it depress me to hear this?

I do NOT want to work towards moderation 'one day'. I really REALLY know that moderation will NEVER work for me.  I really don't know what I am looking for with this post but I suppose just a space to vent my feelings. I feel sad that we aren't on the same path when it comes to sobriety. I want to be positive about it. As much as I want to really push forth the narrative that this is my OWN journey, it's hard to not get a bit blue re my partner still being stuck on finding moderation and/or in denial re what propelled him to become a problem drinker. It's why I cannot share my journey with him. His judgement and also boastfulness about his sobriety make me feel defensive. Maybe it's just my perception of it. Maybe he means well. He says he does. I don't know. In his defense, in my most recent relapses he has been kind but I don't want to discuss the topic further with him as he won't hear out my reasons and besides even if I am to be brutally honest, he draws it back to him. I don't know.

Aside from this, I'm feeling good about day 5. Had a great day with our child and continuing with trying to work out etc. Work isn't going so well and I'm still smoking like a chimney...But aside from this I am reminding myself every reasons I want to quit drinking and also trying to work on a great life without alcohol vs getting through a life without it.

stopdrinking,"The Daily Check-In for Saturday, March 4th: Just for today, I am NOT drinking!","*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

**Big Hugs Y'All!!**

Thank you to each of you for your support and encouragement to one and all. We have a unique space here and I think we all get this. Before I joined r/stopdrinking the extent of my social media was email and texting. And that ain't social media (unless you're a middle-aged dad like moi.) Social media gets a bad rap but my experience here has been life-affirming and life-changing. 

If you have a little extra DCI time this morning, or evening, or afternoon, please give our 1-dayers, 2-dayers and early-dayers a nudge of encouragement. OMG it changed my life to get this feedback from you kind internet strangers in March 2022!!!

And to our 1-dayers, 2-dayers and early-dayers I want you to know something: you are the most heroic person I will ever have the privilege of knowing. You are breaking out of jail and we have the getaway car gassed up and ready-to-go!!

stopdrinking,15 days and 15 hrs.,"Hi again.
I started trying to be sober after 10 years of daily drinking on Jan 3rd. As you can see by my counter I did some field research in between. The first attempt I made it 18 days. While I was visiting with my gramma today I decided I was going to pick up drinks for the weekend. On the way there I told myself I could just take a scenic route home and drive past the exit with the store I was headed to. Didn't. Got a 24 of seltzers. Brought it upstairs, picked one out of the box. I can't actually do it. I kinda liked the idea of having some drinks tonight while my partner works while watching hockey at a pub and then to wind down after a 6 day work week tomorrow. But I just can't follow through. Even feel a bit nauseous just thinking about it. They're now in a closet in a room full of stuff I need to unpack and organise on Sunday. Or at least start unpacking. 
How's everyone else doing tonight? I would love to hear about it whether tonight was also a challenge or if things are awesome.",2023-03-04 04:54:18,1677905658

And I believed you. I kept coming back to you. What if you were right? What if no one will ever love me? I let you beat me down and destroy me. I let you push everyone who dared to care for me out of my life. You isolated me. You ruined me.

stopdrinking,Today I asked my wife for a divorce,"We have been together for 15 years. Married nearly 10. Basically my entire adult life. I’ve known it wasn’t good for a long time, but when you’ve been with someone for so long it can be hard to really face.  

We both drank so much for so long. Before Covid we almost got divorced, but then just froze in place when the lockdown happened and didn’t do anything about it.  

I’ve always wanted to be a dad, and she has become more and more of a career driven person.  

We had a lot of other issues too. Poor communication, lack of mutual support, not many shared interests, and really just ended up leading our own lives.  

I knew in my heart that if I ever wanted to be a dad, I’d have to leave her. If I ever wanted to have the type of relationship I wanted, where I had a partner that I could share life with and build a family, I’d have to find it with someone else.  

At the end of last year I told myself if I stayed on the path I was on, I would never have the courage to do this. I would keep drinking, get sadder and sadder, and probably die early from some alcohol related complications.   

So I started 2023 sober. It’s been really really hard. I just got my 60 day chip yesterday.   

I told myself that when I got to 2-3 months I had to do the next thing in my plan, which was to ask for a divorce.   

I didn’t know what day I would do it, but I knew it would be soon. Last night when I came home from getting my chip, she didn’t even get up to greet me or ask how it went. It was something so important to me and she didn’t even care to ask me about it. So a voice in my head told me that today when she was done with work for the day, that’s when I needed to have the conversation.  

I feel like the wind has been knocked out of me. I’m not scared. I don’t regret it. This is what I knew I needed to do. But it still hurts a lot. My life is about to change in an astronomical way.   

I’m 2 months sober, I’m 38 years old, and I’m about to be single for the first time since I was in my early 20s.  

There’s that thing that all of us who drank know very well. That fear. That voice in our heads. It tells us we’re weak. That we aren’t enough. That we can’t do hard things. It keeps us trapped. It keeps us small.   

I hear that voice right now. It’s telling me I just fucked up. It’s telling me I should try to undo what I just did. It’s telling me that I’m going to spend the rest of my life alone.  

But I’m not going to let that fear control me anymore. What I have realized is that getting sober is an act of extreme courage. It is getting out of the lazy river I’ve been floating down and doing the things that terrify me. I am feeling my fear and doing my best to stare it down. Getting sober is me finally standing up for myself.   

I wish I could say that I feel great. I wish I could tell you all that being sober is the cure all. That would be a lie. This sucks. I am in so much pain.   

But I have known I needed to do this for *years*. But I could never do it. And then I got sober. Two months. And I was able to face this thing I’ve been terrified of for so long.   

That’s the lesson here.  

I could use your support tonight. It would mean a lot. I’m not in danger of drinking. I’m just really sad.  

I love you all. Thanks for always being there for me and for eachother.

stopdrinking,I'm finally the mom my kids deserve,"Ms. Fifteen had a rough day this past weekend. Had her feelings hurt badly by a boy she likes. And because I'm sober, I was able to show up for her in a way that I otherwise never would have.

I was able to really empathize, without trying to minimize the way she felt. I just listened, and sat with her, and let her be upset and angry and hurt. 

And then, late in the afternoon, I suggested we get out and do something fun. So we did. We got fixed up and went out for the evening, first to the trampoline park and then out for dinner. We didn't get home until almost 10pm. We laughed. We jumped. We talked. We ate so much buffet comfort food it was almost embarrassing. We listened to Taylor Swift on repeat all the way home. 

None of this is all that amazing. But if I was still drinking? I would've found some way to minimize her hurt - ""You're fifteen, you don't really even know what love is yet,"" or ""There will be other boys, you'll be fine."" I wouldn't have ever suggested getting out of the house, because I probably would've already been drinking. I would've just tried to turn it off as fast as I could - partly to fix it, and partly because I would have wanted my ""alone time"" with my wine at night. I didn't just drink my hurt away, I used to drink away my kids' hurt, too. I just couldn't handle any of it.

I'm not that mom anymore.

She finally gets to have the mom she deserves.

stopdrinking,"I want to stop drinking, but I don’t know I can do it without medically supervised detox / rehab. But I have a full time job. How do I quit?","So, title sums it up pretty well, but some background. I’m a 45 year old male, I’ve been a heavy drinker since my early 20s, and have considered myself an alcoholic for at least a decade. Over the pandemic it got worse. I usually drink 6-12 light beer every evening, along with 4-10 shots of whiskey. I typically don’t drink during the day, but usually start as soon as I’m able. 
I run my own business, working from home mainly but I spend about a week of every month on the road. I usually drink less on the road actually, but keep a flask of Jameson in my luggage and almost always find a few pints every evening. At home I’m working usually 6 days a week, and have deadlines for repeat clients I can’t just put off without losing their business. 
I feel like I’m a ‘functional’ alcoholic. But I don’t want to be one anymore. It is affecting my health. It’s affecting my relationships - I avoid dating because I don’t want them to realize I’m an addict. I don’t see my friends much because I live in the suburbs and to drive to the city, I need to take an expensive taxi or plan to crash overnight because I can’t go out without planning to drink. 
I was also a heavy cannabis smoker. I smoked pretty much all day when working from home, and always found some for a nightcap on the road. I quit that Feb 1, my lungs just couldn’t hack it. I’m feeling good about that, and the clarity and improved health from quitting weed really has me wanting to quit drinking. But I’m worried about the withdrawal symptoms and know when as far into it as I, that the withdrawal can even threaten my life.  
I can afford rehab. I just can’t afford the time off until at least June. If my business fails I will lose my home and my entire career I’ve built for 25 years. 
I just honestly don’t know what to do, I want to quit but don’t know how I can start.",2023-03-04 02:13:20,1677896000

My struggle was  breaking the habit of drinking 7 nights a week for years just to relax . I didn't think it was a problem, but I thought I'd have a few weeks away from beer to see if this was the reason for depression , it was. I'm not saying it is the only reason but it plays a major part in depression .

Yesterday, I  was so close to going to the liquor store. Every time I go on a bender I struggle with bad anxiety for about a week after. So I was feeling very anxious last night since I just finished a long bender. I began reasoning with myself: I’ll only drink two shots, I’ll drink water so I don’t get hungover at work tomorrow, I feel sad this is the only thing that will make me feel better. I grabbed my wallet, keys, put my jacket/shoes on and everything but I couldn't get myself to walk out the door. I knew that my anxiety was due to alcohol and I would only feel better temporarily. I knew if I drank again last night, that it would only worsen my anxiety today. So I put my stuff away and just laid in bed. I felt like shit mentally, I cried, felt sad/anxious, but when I woke up this morning, I knew it was worth it. I know this is just the beginning and I will have to stay strong countless more times but I really am so proud of myself. I was literally so close to going, but I didn’t. It makes me feel so good. :)

&amp;#x200B;

On another note, does anyone else get bad anxiety just thinking about alcohol? I don’t know how to explain it but it’s kind of like I’ve failed so many times staying sober that I feel like the alcohol is just sitting at the liquor store, mocking me, waiting for me to fail again. And I keep trying to tell myself that I am the one in control, alcohol can’t control me, but it just scares me to even think about going on another bender, blacking out for days, being so excruciatingly hungover that I feel like I can’t breathe. It gives me bad anxiety and I don’t know how to ease it. Maybe it’s cause my brain and body is still recovering from my bender this past week, but it’s just exhausting feeling like every single day is a constant battle where I have to actively be avoiding alcohol. Does it ever get easier? Is it ever not on your mind 24/7? It’s draining having this one thing be on my mind all the time.

What I have been craving, however, is a drink. It had been a good long while since I wanted a sip of whisky or glass of wine. But I have spent the last several days in almost constant craving mode. I have heard of post anesthesia hangovers. Could this be some sort of anesthesia induced relapse or something? Anyone else ever walk this road? Any advice?

Thanks!

stopdrinking,7th month has been the hardest,The pink cloud has completely evaporated.  All the memories about my life are coming back to me now and I don't like what I'm seeing.

stopdrinking,Need advice for dealing with constant criticism,"My partner has what feels like an instinct to criticize me for just about everything.  When I was drinking, I either ignored it (forgot about it) or felt he was right appropriate since I had probably made a mistake. 

After a few days of severe depression, I decided to get up and work out this morning just to try and break through it. I didn't feel much better, but at least felt a little proud for accomplishing something productive. 

I told my partner when he got back from work, and he immediately criticized me for being a ""wimp"" because I wasn't as strong as him. 

As so many of you know, these early days of sobriety make you feel vulnerable. I'm extremely fragile right now, and can barely contain my own emotions, and I need support more than just about anything else right now. Criticisms can come later, but not now. 

I know I should be proud of what I've done and trying to do, and looking for applause from others will only lead to disappointment, but just an occasional nice word now and then would mean the world. 

Any advice on how not internalize these criticisms, especially when I'm feeling so vulnerable?",2023-03-03 20:43:15,1677876195
stopdrinking,Having a hard time finding forgiveness,"My boyfriend went out and got wasted Wednesday night. He didn’t respond to any of my texts and I knew he would drive home basically black out. I kept texting him that I can give him a ride if he needs one and to please not drive drunk. Nothing, not one word from him.
We live near each other so I drove down to his place to let his dog out and since I hadn’t heard from him I figured he was still out.
I found him asleep in his bed, totally drunk. He wouldn’t talk to me and kept dismissing me and telling me to stop. 
This doesn’t happen often and paints a bad picture of him. But, it is what happened Wednesday night. 
I am 2 months sober and I can’t find myself to forgive him. He forgave a lot of my stupid shit I’ve done in the past because of alcohol so I really am not one to blame. I know what I’m really mad at is alcohol but I can’t seem to forgive and forget and move on. I feel like I have no compassion and it is hurting me. 
I want what is best for him but I’m have a hard time finding the love and am holding onto the anger.

But the cardiologist says I'm young and pretty enough to avoid more episodes. So what are the risks factors? You guessed it! 

Long story short, I watched the old man drink himself into morbid obesity and death. I swore that if I ever got the same health warnings, I'd listen to the quacks.

When I was single I went crazy. I did sickening things that I don’t know I’ll ever be able to forgive myself for. I don’t know how I’m alive because I made such poor choice while drunk. 

22 I became pregnant. I was going to be a single mom and viewed it as a way to reinvent myself. I didn’t drink for two years. Then I met my now husband and we built a great life together. However, for the past three years alcohol has crept back into my life.

I realized I had an issue this year when I was hiding it. I decided I’m going to quit. Now I look at myself in the mirror and hate myself. I gained 60 pounds due to alcohol, hate the choices I made when I was younger, and feel like I was not always present with my child. Alcohol was my escape I 100% recognize it.

stopdrinking,Sometimes sobriety is like living life on hard mode.,"M32 here, sober 1 year 4 days. 

I definitely binge-drank to cope with depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. 

Now that I’m sober, some of those things got better, but they can still creep up every now and then. Only now, I don’t have that ‘escape hatch’ of drinking. I know if I hadn’t stopped drinking, I would’ve drank myself to death. It’s partly what keeps me from picking up a drink now. 

And it’s really hard sometimes, to live life completely sober, often without any relief or sense of getting out of myself. I take antidepressants and see a therapist. But there were times when drink was the cure to it all. Now I have to live without it.

stopdrinking,"I have to accept who I am when I'm actively drinking, whether or not I'm drunk","I've been on and off trying to stop drinking for about 5 years. Sometimes it's better, sometimes it's worse. I went 2 months without drinking this fall and went to smart recovery. Got cocky, thought I could regulate. 

A couple weeks ago I got drunk on two separate occasions and cheated on my partner. We were in an open relationship and I crossed a very clear boundary we set for it. I want to blame it on the alcohol, but I lied about it when I was sober too. I didn't want to face the fact that the drinking was still an issue. 

At the end of the day, when I'm drinking I am untrustworthy, greedy, and selfish regardless of whether or not I've had any alcohol at a certain moment. That is **not** who I am when I'm sober. Not who I want to be. I am so lucky I have a partner who is willing to work past my selfish and hurtful actions. I owe it to him, our relationship, and to myself to be the person I want to be.

stopdrinking,Sobriety is a hero's journey,"I know those of us who struggle with quitting can often feel less than, flawed, and like we're trying to fix ourselves because we're somehow broken.

I've been starting to think of sobriety differently. Sobriety is not just about giving up, but also about daring to ask more from life. It's about daring to chart a new path in life, daring to express a whole new identity, daring to walk through life surrounded by temptations without yielding.

It's strength, compassion and empathy. I'm excited about the adventure I'm embarking on, and beyond the benefits of sobriety, I'm keenly aware of the immense challenge I and all of you have undertaken. Whether it's day 1, or day 10000, we're all on this same journey.

I'm proud of myself, and I'm proud of you! I hope any of you who are struggling can see this modern day hero's journey you've embarked on, and can see each struggle and roadblock as the bridge of this beautiful melody we are all composing.

I told her I don't know and that maybe every couple of months to buy NA drinks.

She then told me that most of her customers are alcoholics and very few people own it, and the fact that I recognized it and did something about it, I had her respect. This is an old biker no-nonsense lady, and I can tell her respect is not easy to come by. So that was pretty cool.

stopdrinking,Stopping tomorrow and feeling nervous,"Hi all, first post but have been reading through here for a long time. Many of you have inspired me to stop for periods of time, so thank you for that.

I've been drinking heavily for the better part of 5 years now. It started becoming problematic in my marriage over the past year when I'd start blurting out all of my insecurities and starting (verbal) fights while drunk, and my wife has had enough. I started therapy to find the source of these insecurities so I can work them out.

I'm at the point where I know my drinking is an issue, and it's exhausting to have that ""well, it's almost drinking time"" thought at the same time each day, then drink so much in the first hour that I'm too tired to do anything with my wife for the rest of the day and end up going to bed at 8pm. She's bored, lonely, and fed up.

Despite all of this, I'm finding it really hard to stop. I want to so badly because I want a better life, but when that time of day rolls around, I have an extremely hard time fighting it. Weekends are worse, because all day is considered *that* time.

I'm trying to use an upcoming trip for a friend's wedding as an excuse to stop for a few weeks so I can shed some pounds, and get rid of the dark circles under my eyes. That's why I wanted to stop starting tomorrow (a friend's birthday is today and I know there's no way I won't cave at the bar).

All of this probably sounds like many other's journeys at the beginning, making excuses and saying ""tomorrow, today won't work because of X"". I could really use some help and advice, and mostly, how *that* time of day became something else for you.

How I felt about my life:

* I hated, and still hate, my job. I wfh and I wouldn't really miss my coworkers if I left. I'd never spend time with any of them outside work.
* I lived alone, and it sometimes made me feel very lonely.
* I stayed in and tried to drink through all the beers in my cupboard, waiting to start naltrexone.
* I didn't really have many friends, a lot of my social life was casual dating, and I was so low I often stayed in and drank by myself.
* I was single and a little scarred from a guy who got really creepy when I said I wanted to move on b/c we had no future

A few things have changed since I quit:

* I started a relationship and did a lot of damage to it with my moodiness and clinginess
* I pulled away from activities that no longer brought me joy, and started trying new ones - tried one new thing so far, not great
* I started actively trying to rebuild my social network post-mania, reconnecting with people who care deeply for me
* I started seeing a new therapist to get over my fears and pains. I haven't really progressed much after six session

I have been to rehab for 1 week now, and have about 6 weeks to go. It’s a really nice place, lots of activities, relaxing and therapy. 

A key takeaway which has helped me a lot is to get rid of the feeling of shame. My therapist put shame as being an absolute worthless feeling. It’s not constructive, it doesn’t help you nor anyone else. Focus on being proud for trying hard, give your self some understanding. Treat yourself like you would treat a friend. If a friend told you “I have an issue with alcohol”, would you shame them or show them support? I bet the latter. 

To sum up; be a friend to yourself, let go of shame, be honest with those around you and take one day at the time. If I can do 14 days, so can you.

stopdrinking,How do you handle someone with terminal cirrhosis at the end of their life?,"Hi there, I've been a long term lurker and you've all helped me so much. It really pains me to ask this question on here, but here goes...

My GFs dad is 57 and he is a violent, narcissistic, alcoholic and has recently reentered our lives after violently and explosively leaving 8 months ago when he was last staying with us and taken to hospital. 

We picked up his saga last Sunday when we had multiple calls that he was in town (He lives 9 hours away), in VERY bad health, no money and his hotel accommodation was about to expire. He was emaciated to the point where he looks like a skeleton with some skin hanging off it, has jaundice, fully incontinent, delirious on a loop and blood everywhere after a big fall. We managed to get him to a hospital where he violently left after not being seen to immediately (Had to get the cops involved). After another day of care, fluids, salts and sugars we managed to get him coherent enough to go back. We pulled out all the stops and stayed with him full time and brought everything he wanted (other than drugs or alcohol) He lasted 2 days and got well enough to threaten his way back out of hospital and signed himself out and headed for the closest pub.

For 3 hours he was threatening and blaming us whilst demanding to come back to our house. The last couple of times he stayed with us, he basically sapped off us for a month or two and left violently. So we made the decision that he isn't welcome here anymore. So we've put him up in the only hotel he agreed to where he's continued to barrage use with hateful messages, blaming us for alienating him from his own family and friends whilst demanding Uber rides and us bring him money for booze. 

He's told us outright that he doesn't want help, he's sick of doctors, refuses to sign a power of attorney to my GF or her family and is coherent enough after a blood transfusion to check himself out of hospital. So we can't keep him there against his will. But wants us to keep him in the $500 a night hotel (To punish us for not allowing him in our house - his words), pay for his travel and give him an allowance as he has no wallet. 

It's heartbreaking watching my GF go through this and my heart sinks every time her or my phone rings, we've spent all week and thousands of dollars that we don't have looking after him (After we said we wouldn't do this again), just for him to throw it in our faces, like every time before. I'm really at a loss as to what to do. If we send him home to be by himself he will almost certainly pass away, but I feel it would be the same result with him here. Doctors have given him 6 months if he looks after himself, I don't think he'll last the month without intervention.

stopdrinking,Alcohol Taper,"Hey All, (note, please ignore spelling errors and run on sentences)

Im new to reddit but have read quite a lot of posts on alcohol tapering. Since Covid I have been drinking pretty regularly (seems to be a common theme.) I was drinking every other night, or a few nights in a row and then taking days off. probably around October of 2022 I started drinking nightly. It started small, just enough to get me buzzed and get some sleep. Then I started drinking more. I tried to stick to three 100ml bottles of jack daniels a night (2 &amp; 1/2 shots per bottle) some nights i would drink more than that, but I tried to stick to those 3. And then when I found myself having more than those 3, I finally realized I had a problem and needed to stop.... Then I started reading everything up on alcohol withdrawal. I already struggle with anxiety and can be a hypochondriac. I started looking in to detox, but my insurance is terrible, and im broke right now. So detox didn't seem like an option. I thought ""well, i can just keep drinking this same amount until i can save up money for detox..."" but that could take months to a year to be able to really do for me. So i decided my best option was to very slowly start tapering and create a schedule to stick to. Now, all of this may be over kill. I have read about people on who drink more, but I have also read about people drink much less and have withdrawals. SO I started tapering with my 3 bottles of 100ML jack. I got a measuring glass and have been reducing .5 ounces per night. Starting at 10.2 ounces, I am now down to 5.8. I have not had any withdrawal symptoms. I have stuck very strictly to this taper. But im reaching the point where im starting to get concerned that the lower I go the more dangerous it could get... its probably my hypochondria coming in to play. But, I am sticking to my schedule thus far. Tonight I will go down another .5 ounces.

I guess i just wanted any advice from anyone who might have knowledge on this? I have no withdrawals so far, but am terrified that they will come. I want to be off this stuff already. It's just medicine to me at this point to help me taper. I'm tired of it.

stopdrinking,I don’t know what I’m doing.,"I am a high-functioning alcoholic, and I’ve finally admitted it to myself. Not just in my head, but out loud and to my closest friend. Too embarrassed to use that descriptor when discussing with my wife, so she thinks I’m taking a break. Of course, in my heart I know she knows and I’m just hiding myself from whatever emotion I’d feel about my wife having married an alcoholic. I’ve known for a long time now that my drinking was becoming a problem. I have a family history of alcoholism. I can remember a moment freshman year of college (many moons ago) when a guy I lived with said something to the effect of “I wish I was like you. You get drunk and nothing about you changes. You’re still just you”. I should’ve known that was a bad sign, but with age comes wisdom, right? Hindsight and all that. 

My anxiety has started to cripple my ability at work and I’m social settings. In the past I’ve always drank through the anxiety until eventually I’m buzzed enough to not feel that way anymore. It’s a crutch for me like it is for so many others. I’m scared of having to strictly regiment my life to avoid the drinking. I’m scared of not being able to go to my favorite restaurants because I’ve always drank there, to excess a lot of the time. I’m scared of a lot of stuff all of the sudden. 


Anyway, I finally decided I need to make a change and my god, the cravings. I’ve never had cravings before. It’s like my brain is a teenager and someone told it “you can’t have this” and now it consumes every thought. And I don’t know how to turn it off.

Other than that, I have no idea what I can do other than lock myself in the house. My job requires me to be social and we have a function tomorrow. Open bar of course. I don’t want to wake up, go to work, and come home just to repeat the cycle for the rest of my life, but that’s what it feels like I’m going to have to do.

stopdrinking,New member. 715 days clean.,"Hello to eveyone. (sorry for my bad english)

So, I'm 23 and I'm sober for almost two years (2 years in 15 days!). But I had accepted my AUD and SUD since 2019 and I've been trying since then, on and off all the time. Everything changed for me when I started accepting help from the people around me, especially when I found a community that helps people like us. I'm in a public rehab programme during most of this time. But I wanted to find a community where I can share things and I can give and who knows maybe say something helpful. It's so nice that there is something you can access through your phone any hour of the day and it's very helpful reading your stories, so thank you. 

It's been a very very difficult journey but I am so happy that I made this present to myself. My whole life changed, every aspect of it. I would never ever take it back. Every day I am more grateful for my decision to stay sober and I don't think I'll ever drink again, I just hope nothing changes that.

Since I remember myself, even when I was drinking myself to death and smoking weed heavily, I was always thinking that the strongest people there are must be the ones who completely control themselves and beat the almost unbeatable monster of addiction, those who are natural leaders of themselves.

I can't believe I'm becoming one (or that I already am).",2023-03-03 16:14:45,1677860085

stopdrinking,Been majorly cutting down on my drinking,"I was never a heavy drinker before Covid. I barely drank at all, in fact - maybe once every few months when we had dinner with friends. I don't even know at what point things started sliding downhill during the pandemic, but I discovered Truly Lemonades and suddenly I was drinking at least a 24-pack a week, and a box of wine every two-three weeks. 

I found myself studying alcohol content on different beverages to get the most bang for my buck, trying to be sneaky about how many empty cans were piling up in our garage (we live in MI with a 10 cent returnable deposit on each can so we take empties back to the store), and moving from bottled wine to boxed wine because it wasn't as obvious how quickly I was drinking a box since you couldn't see it. I didn't want my husband to realize how much I was drinking.

I finally had a moment of clarity like a month and a half ago where I realized I really don't want to continue down this path. I feel like I'm at a crossroads where I can take steps now to return my consumption to healthy levels, or keep going as I am now and become a full-blown alcoholic like so many of my family members. I somehow found motivation I hadn't had every time I tried the past year or so. I've been dramatically cutting down, doing my best not to drink on ""school nights"" and keep it to one or two drinks on a weekend evening.  

Last night I had a Truly in my hand and was ready to pop it open (it's more the habit that's hard to break for me at this point), and I was like, ""No. I'm not doing this."" So I put it back in the fridge. I'm proud of myself.",2023-03-03 15:55:22,1677858922
stopdrinking,Not sure if I belong in the recovery space,"I 29 (F) have a hard time committing to quitting drinking because I don’t necessarily associate as an alcoholic. 

I don’t drink everyday, I go the whole week without drinking but always have a few drinks over the weekend. Sometimes out with friends this turns into excess and has resulted in multiple blackouts before, drinking and driving, ending up in the hospital and mental health ward. But sometimes when I drink at home I can stop at one or two. 

I never turn down a drink, always up for the party to keep going. I’ve noticed recently as I’ve gotten older hangovers are awful, have caused me to call out of work more than once and now if I only drink a few I still have hanganxiety and depression. I am also on two antidepressants that you aren’t supposed to drink on but have failed to stop completely. 

All week I am reading quit lit, listening to sober podcasts and believing I can be sober. I even thought about going to a meeting but don’t really feel like I would belong. For some reason when it get to Friday I tend to rationalize having a few drinks. 

Today I have a work event where there will be alcohol involved. I’m already thinking if I have a couple it won’t be so bad but I know that will lead me to continuing to drink over the weekend. If I don’t drink I feel like I am missing out on something I guess.

stopdrinking,Fell off and got back on,"It’s been a bit of a ride. After successfully completing Dry January, having a few drinks with friends in the weeks following, and, ultimately, going back to my old daily drinking habits for just under a week, I’ve got some personal observations and wondered if anyone else has experienced same. 

As I mentioned, I did dry jan and then some. I felt amazing both mentally and physically. For the past month and a half, I’ve really felt as though I’d turned some major corner with my relationship with alcohol. I was so certain that it was a near impossibility that I could ever go back to how I used to feel. The resolve I felt was almost shocking. I felt like a different person in a way. Then, following a somewhat traumatic experience (a bad LSD trip) last week, I found myself daily drinking again. During this week, it became more and more clear that my perspective was changing. I found myself back in my old behavior pattern of heading to my favorite cafe/bar around noon to work (I’m remote and in IT), having 4-5 drinks until around 5pm, then heading home to watch Tv for rest of the night. During this week, as it went on, I kept yelling myself “this is the last day I do this…) and next day rolls around and I felt almost compelled to go back and drink again. It started getting a little scary when I began to realize that some switch had been flipped in my head and I was as now back to the “drinking” position. Worst part is that I found it nearly impossible to remember what it was like to have the resolve to NOT drink only a week earlier! Long story short, I ended up having an uncomfortable, yet unrelated conversation with a close friend and she called me out if my drinking. That night while sitting on the couch, some switch flipped again and I new with certainty that I was back on the wagon, and that I’d not be drinking again. And here I am 2 days later, with the same powerful resolve I had all through a January.

I honestly don't even know how long I've been drinking heavily, 4-8double vodkas a day, sometimes starting from the time I wake up until I pass out and maybe get up and have a few more before passing out for the night. I know it's been Years. 

Around Thanksgiving I started trying to cut way back and made it maybe 5 days. I begged my roommate and drinking buddy to PLEASE help me by no longer having it in the house. If I see it I'm going to drink it, if I hear you in the next room mixing and stirring it'll be all I can think about!

Well you can't force someone, so whatever I gave up trying a week into January and actively started buying bottles. 

She started feeling crappy and began sleeping constantly. She started slurring her words and wobbling and stumbling after only having one drink. I kept pestering her to go see her Dr,  I knew there was something wrong. After 2 straight weeks of my mentioning it multiple times a day (still drinking myself daily) she agreed. Ran some tests and her DR did worry it was diabetes.

Roommate went to go get some tests done for a volunteer medical study at a local college before her regular Dr called with any results. The nurse at the med study drew blood and said ""you have raging diabetes, like off the charts""
She called and told me yesterday. I went and dumped everything out instantly. She's on board and we've made a deal to do this together!

I know it can be a manageable thing. But I'm kicking myself thinking that something could have happened to her-she was sleeping like 20 hours a day! And I was just sitting there. I'm scared and mad at myself and disappointed and embarrassed. I haven't been to see a Dr in a couple years and I just know deep down I probably have it too. I've had blurry vision for awhile I kept telling myself it's because I read on my tablet way to much and it's messing with my eyes. I looked at my diet and it basically solid sugar, even without the alcohol, it's sugary juice, pastas and bread.

Yes I'll be making an appointment and be taking her to the Dr on Tuesday. In the mean time I'm going started doing everything I can to kick start repairing my body. Today will be my second day with no alcohol! I have a gallon of water ready to be drank (I rarely drink water unless it's melted ice cubes). Yesterday I cleaned the house took my neighbors dog on a 2.5 mile walk, and for the first time I reached 10,000 steps on my health watch I've had since mid January!! It vibrates and has party balloons on the screen when you reach 10k!  I want to try to walk him everyday, they love it because they're old and handicapped, dog loves it because he's a big ole bear who otherwise chills on the couch most of the day.

stopdrinking,Today,"Hey all!
I just wanted to share that today was the first day the drinking urge started to creep up on me since I decided 11 days ago that moderation is not for me and accepted that fact as reality. 


I had myself convinced that eventually I’ll get it right and not buy more than I need, not wake up in the morning and drink while working, not lie to my partner about how much I drank or if I was even drinking at all.

 
I could not accept the fact that alcohol just doesn’t jive with my brain chems. I wanted so badly to be able to drink like a normal person. 


I tried and failed over and over and over again. 


I’d been an almost daily drinker from about the age of 19-28. Went to rehab at age 28. Managed to stay sober nine months, which is my longest time ever. I thought after nine months, I could control it one night well that one night let me back into a three year binge. 


After that I tied to control it, once a month, once a week, 2 times a week and so on and so on.. it would work for a bit but it wouldn’t stick. 


11 days ago, nothing bad happened this time thankfully.. but something just snapped in me and changed how I see myself and alcohol. 


It causes me to make poor decisions, lose care, lie, lose sleep, screw up work and relationships, not eat right, DUI (2 of them.. years ago) .. the list can go on and on and on turn into someone I am not. I feel shame that I can’t control it, I lose confidence and go into hermit mode.


I don’t know how I came to peace and acceptance this time, but I have.


The urge today felt strange. But I didn’t cave. Instead I got myself some CBD j’s and weed drinks and sparking water to have tonight after work. 


I just wanted to share. This sub really is giving m strength, just reading others struggles and strengths. I see myself in so many of you.

stopdrinking,I just fucked myself over in my ADHD-screening,"Hi guys. I just wanted to vent a little as I feel a little defeated, frustrated, and shocked.

So, about 5-6 years ago, I was struggling a bit with alcohol abuse where i drank to numb myself rather than to have fun. I decided to take a long break, and when I was ready again I decided to ONLY and exclusively drink if there is a fun event going on, and drink for the ""right"" reasons.

I've managed to do that lately, and alcohol hasn't really had a negative impact on me in the last 3 years. Some months that means not drinking at all, and other months it might be every weekend (never weekdays).

I started the process of getting evaluated for ADHD a couple of months ago, as I've been suspecting it for a couple of years and finally felt that i had the determination and ability to push through my bad patience to get evaluated. 2 weeks ago, i had to leave a blood test for them to make sure that i am drug free and not drinking too much (more than 12 units a week).

The past 4-5 weeks has been filled with concerts, celebrating my best friend's 30th, girlfriend's workplace-party, and a couple of nights out with great friends of mine. It hasn't been negative, any of it. It's all been so much fun, and it hasn't been any embarrassing or drunken stupidity going on. However, my blood test went passed the allowed limit and i scored 0.39 when I'm only allowed to score 0.30 in this particular blood-value. I'm not sure what the measure is, but i think it's some acid that's produced in your blood to break down alcohol, and traces of that acid can be shown up to a month after drinking alcohol. 

This result means that they can't continue to evaluate me for now. Obviously I've had too much alcohol. The results doesn't lie, and I'm not looking for excuses or to shift blame away from myself. It just feels so shitty, that despite me being able to drink to have fun and doesn't affect my life negatively (until now), I still failed the test and am apparently still drinking too much according to the healthcares standards. It's definitely a wake up call, and has made me think about how i actually consume alcohol, but i can't help but feel defeated, especially when my liver health looked great on the results.

So where do I go now? Well, the laboratory personell recommend that the best approach is ""the patient should stay completely sober for 2 months to prove he's capable of doing that"", and then i can come for the second blood test. I will do what they ask of me, as i really, really want to follow through with this evaluation to the very end, but damn do i feel like i just made things harder for myself once again, and if i just took the blood test a couple weeks later I'd probably pass the blood test. But yeah, not much to do about it now rather than to bite the bullet and sleep in the bed I've made for myself.

English is not my native language, so I'm sorry if there was any errors. I'm 28 years old if anyone reading was wondering and read all of this. Thanks guys!",2023-03-03 13:46:57,1677851217

stopdrinking,Past the point of “sober curious”,"I think I’ve finally decided it’s time. Today is the last day I wake up feeling like complete shit and the final time of binge drinking in front of Netflix on a random Tuesday night.

My relationship with alcohol has controlled most of my adult life. My first boyfriend joked that my 21st birthday “lasted an entire year.” I’m now 31, and for the past decade have drank heavily and consistently through the good and bad — the death of a parent, a divorce, and everything else in between. 

I want to take this seriously but I have so many question and I don’t know where or how to start. 

1. Do you pick a sober date? Does it have to be today? For example, my birthday is Saturday. I know I’ll want a drink at dinner (or realistically 5-6). Why doesn’t it ever feel like a good time to quit?

2. Do you tell people? My partner obviously knows I’m struggling. I’ve also had friends and family intervene over the years. Do I have to make it a grand announcement? For people to support, or to tread carefully at functions? Or do I quietly begin this journey in what feels to be all alone?

3. Do I tell my work colleagues? For example, I’m an American living in London where the drinking culture is huge. Most days in the office end with nights in the pub. How do I come up with endless excuses not to go?

4. Why is all of this centred around what other people might think? Did anyone else feel this way?

5. Does alcohol-free beer even taste any good?

6. What am I going to do about my social life? Will I take up new interests or rediscover old hobbies?

7. Will people still invite me places? Will I even want to go?

8.Will I lose weight? Is that the silver lining in all this?

9. What do you do in moments of weakness?  Does it ever get easier?

10. What is something you wish you knew going into your sobriety?

Any and all (kind) advice welcome.",2023-03-03 13:26:49,1677850009
stopdrinking,What inspires you?,"Hello, 

I have been struggling with alcohol for a couple of decades now.  Lately, I have been here 1-4 times a day and I have been doing better.  My biggest downfall is the urges when I am out and about.  In my state every grocery store and gas station sells beer and wine. Like heck... at least I can pay at the pump and not go inside - but I have to NOT GO INSIDE THE STORE.

I've checked a few sober apps and I don't find that they are all that great with urges and cravings.  Meetings are a great idea, but when I wake up at 5 a.m. there are no meetings going on.  So I read a lovely post by Charles\_D13th: 

Getting sober has nothing to do with giving something up. It’s about taking everything back. I had this wrong for years.

  You gain control.

  You gain time.

  You gain health and wellness.

  You gain in your bank.

SSSsssoooo I copied this down and I started looking for other ""inspirational"" messages.  My plan is to put it together, print it and keep it in my car.  When I am feeling weak, I can simply pull over and read a bit... gather strength and go on with a sober day.

If you have a minute, please share what inspires you with this floundering alcoholic.  Thank you for your time... and thanks to Charles\_D13th.",2023-03-03 13:21:05,1677849665

I don't socialize unless there's alcohol involved. I often get too drunk and do very embarrassing or dangerous things. Drinking and hangovers take up a lot of my free time. I don't think that drinking is ruining my life but it is making it much harder than it has to be. 

I don't plan to drink again but I already notice that my brain is starting to rationalize further drinking because ""I'm not actually that bad"" and ""Other people have actual issues with alcohol, you're just being dramatic"", even though my weekly/bi-weekly binge drinking is obviously horrible to my mental and physical health. My family is also heavy drinkers and I'm afraid I won't be able to stay my ground if they start pressing me about drinking.

stopdrinking,I started IOP,"32F, weekend binger here.
After blacking out and basically ruining my one year wedding anniversary weekend, I finally made the decision to do something.

I started an evening IOP (intensive out patient) program. It’s 3 nights a week 6-9PM, so right after work. It will be a lot of work and a difficult schedule but, just after two days I feel so hopeful. It’s a combination of individual and group therapy, groups can be things like yoga, or an accountability and goals group. There’s about 10 people total and so far they’re all so great, and so are the therapists.

They also acknowledge and treat the underlying anxiety and depression (for those who have it), and I know I certainly do. They also drug and alcohol test weekly, 1-2x week, so I will be “held accountable”, because I want so badly to finish this. I believe it’s 3 months.

I’m really excited and hope this is the solution I’ve been looking for. Have a great weekend all you lovely people, IWNDWYT.",2023-03-03 12:22:55,1677846175
stopdrinking,I'm ok with being labeled &amp; I'm grateful for this community,"I've written here about my own personal struggles with AUD off-and-on over the past year or two, and one of my biggest challenges in sobriety has been not wanting to be labeled as an alcoholic or someone who struggles with drinking. The more time I spend here, and the more I study the disorder, the more I realize (a) there are so many other amazing people here who are just like me; and (b) just how poisonous alcohol really is, how it's probably the most dangerous drugs we can ever consume, because (c) alcohol is everywhere - it underpins almost every social activity we partake. 

It's impossible to avoid. 

I went 8 months AF last year. I'd made it through New Year's, dry January (and February), spring break, business dinners, trips and and happy hours, and an entire summer's worth of activities, music festivals, weekend afternoons at the pool or at the lake with friends, all the while sipping my AF beers and soda waters. 

It wasn't easy at times but mostly, I'd gotten through unscathed, sober and free of any of the usual trouble I always seemed to find with alcohol. You know, drink too much and say the wrong thing or spend entire weekends chasing away hangovers with too much booze, beer, wine or whatever was on ice. 

Oddly though, my wife and I weren't as connected as I thought we'd be over that time, physically or emotionally. Looking back at it, I don't know what it was but after 10+ years of dealing with my overconsumption, I can only guess she was struggling with her own issues in my sobriety. I missed her though, and after 8 months AF , I started engaging with the idea that I could moderate. My alcoholic brain lulled me into a false sense of security and convinced me to think, ""hey, you've got this...this is something you can control."" 

""Why shouldn't you be able to have a few drinks with the love of your life, just like before?"" I'd started asking myself. Once I planted that seed, it grew into a bit of an obsession. 

Then, I'd gotten an opportunity to fly first class overseas on arguably the most luxurious airlines to one of the most unreal cities on earth, and I thought, ""you don't really want to miss out on that amazing first class service do you?"" 

Then, one night in August, at dinner with my wife, I broke my fast. It was great at first because, ""*I was back* and in control!""

For all of about two weeks, I was in control. It didn't take long for me to start breaking all the rules. I was drinking too much. I wasn't honest about it with myself or my wife. I wasn't having fun. My wife wasn't having fun. I felt like shit. I was starting to look like shit again, and after six months of stumbling and fumbling (and leaving a path of damage, broken trust and more hurt in my wake), I'm honest to god so happy that ***I'M BACK HERE***, with all of you in this group. 

I've re-read my old posts, and see your new stories flow in daily and think, this is me and this is where I belong, in a life of recovery in pursuit of sobriety and true happiness. ***I'm ok with the label*** because I'm not alone, and alcohol is a fucking ruthless drug. 

It doesn't care about me, it doesn't care about my family. It only wants one thing. And I'm fucking done with it.

stopdrinking,Book that documents the life of an alcoholic from the perspective of inanimate objects around him,"Hi guys, hope everyone is doing good and staying strong.

I have a challenging relationship with alcohol and have done for years. I’ve quit drinking too many times to count, and the longest I’ve gone without a drink in the last four years is three months.

Mostly, I’m in control now, but not always. Because, let’s face it, there’s no such thing as being ‘in control’ of alcohol.

Anyway, I wrote a semi-autobiographical book about my experiences as a writer and creative with alcohol. 

However, even in book form, my issues are hard to face. So, the book is told from the perspective of a pencil and a bottle of alcohol. 

It’s called Matita: The Tragic Tale of a Writer’s Pencil, and writing this book is one of the most therapeutic things I’ve done in recent years.

stopdrinking,I was blind.,"Looking back, I'm astonished that it took me so long to realize that I had a problem with alcohol.

I'm not too dumb, down to earth, but I couldn't see the signs, which started pretty early tbh.

I started drinking a lot when I got into college, and I started having repeated blackouts pretty consistently. Did some stupid stuff at the time, but nothing too serious. I still felt some shame, but it usually wore out by the next party. 

A couple years later, I started to get a bit tired of making an ass of myself, so did the only think that made sense: I started drinking by myself. I drank something like 1L of rhum over 5 working days, and quite a bit more during the weekend. 

I started however to control it when I was at parties, which obviously didn't work out. 

I think it took me like something like 5 years to realize how big my problem was. It was a really progressive process. Being around alcohol and intoxicated friends all the time didn't really help I guess. 

It then took another 5  years to get things under control. Writing this, I realize just now that the downwards spiral started 10 years ago. And I'm not even 30.

I'm in a much better place right now, the urge to drink is a lot more manageable, and I don't notice it most days. I still struggle a lot with guilt and shame though.

I don't really know where I'm going with this. I'm just amazed by how pernicious alcohol is, and our willingness to fill our body with poison.

stopdrinking,15 yrs ago I walked out of a detox facility.,"15 yrs ago i turned 31. That day i was scared and angry and jealous of ppl who werent like me. Brett Farve was on t.v. cryin about somethin not nearly as difficult as not drinking that day.

 My friend came by and refused to take my no when he offered me a job. Turns out he was a life preserver i latched onto. Drove me to meetings on rain days. Put up with the mood swings. Told ppl who used to treat the work truck like a portable tavern it was now a N.A. Truck. Love ya like herpes Dave L

I went to a meeting and asked this angry prick if he would talk to me about being a sponsor. The next day he made me ask, and he new it was uncomfortable and i wanted to punch him and drink. That man saved my life. Ty Dave K.

The first yr was brutal but meetings btwn work kept me sober. My home group let me act like a fool and be out of line. I learned later they werent lying when they said the new human brings more to a meeting than 50yr sober members.

I got divorced this summer. And im angry and im scared and lonely. But right now im in my old bar watchin my drunk friend throw out bowers and call ridiculous hands. Im gonna drive him home later. And in a few yrs im gonna bury him bcuz he couldnt accept the gift i tried to give him. 

My son is on the same path as me. Im powerless. That i cant accept yet. 

Tonight im going to bed sober. Tomm is gonna be a shitshow but im gonna wade thru. And if i can just not pick up the first drink i have a half a shot at getting through this alive. Iwndwyt",2023-03-03 08:07:15,1677830835

I take medications dad, I can’t mix alcohol with my Zoloft and Adderall. And even if I could, I told you that I don’t want to, why don’t you get it? Why do you pressure me to drink constantly? It hurts to be around you. 

I’m sorry this disappoints you and makes you think that I’m a “pussy”. I know you’re just trying to be funny, but I’m not amused and you know that. Is my presence not enough?

stopdrinking,Friend thinks I am obsessed with sobriety and that is a red flag to him,"A friend of mine told me yesterday, that he thinks I don't have a drinking problem, that I could just moderate my drinking and that I am obsessed with sobriety and talk too much about it, which is a red flag  to him. He is a normie and I feel so misunderstood and violated. I actually always felt I could open up to him and thought he would understand. It's true, I am 4,5 months sober and I do talk a lot about this subject. I don't get preachy though or so I thought. It all hit me lately how much I drank, how it ruined so much and how it destroyed my health - I had really high liver enzymes before I stopped and he knows about all that. I do feel tons better now. I am meeting other sober people and my life is slowly changing, sobriety truly has a massive impact on me and I realise how obsessed society is with alcohol and how it's normalised. Still, I am not telling anyone to stop drinking and friends get smashed in front of me on a regular basis. It's fine, the comments from him really throw me off however. Should I keep more quiet about it? Has anyone had to deal with comments like that? How would you deal with comments like this? I need advise.

stopdrinking,Well…here we go again,"I’ve posted here before but not for a long time. I (29F) realised I had a drinking problem around the age of 24 (probably earlier in reality but I was in denial) but didn’t seek help until I was 26. I found an amazing doctor who helped me get sober and I had a year of sobriety before I relapsed as I did what many of us do and thought I could moderate…well I can’t, it’s one glass…then the next thing you know it’s whole bottle of wine or more. 

I drink minimum of 1 bottle of wine but usually close to 2 (and on really bad days, 3 bottles) daily. It’s affected my relationship terribly, meant I’ve continued to settle for less at work, made me put on so much weight and made me forget what makes me happy outside of drinking. 

I almost always drink alone and usually hiding it from my partner until he realises I’ve been drinking (he doesn’t realise every night but I’m sure there’s nights he’s suspected it and not said anything) and then we fight or have a hard conversation because of my lying. I’ve finally had enough of the cycle and today I went back to the same doctor who helped me get sober originally - I’ve seen him for various reasons over the years and he knows I’ve been struggling on and off for the last couple of years but not to the extent it is as I’ve tried so hard to hide all my issues from everyone. 

Long story short, I told him how much I’ve been drinking and how I’m scared of withdrawals. He wanted to send me to rehab but I begged for one last chance to do it at home. Last time I got sober he prescribed me Valium to help with the withdrawals. This time he would only prescribe me Valium if we called my partner together and put him in charge of my Valium because due to my addictive nature, my doctor was worried I would take the Valium while I was drinking and stop breathing - whether he thought I would do this intentionally or unintentionally, I’m not sure.

My partner has been incredibly supportive overall despite all my lying and sneakiness when it comes to alcohol and has agreed to do this and look after me for the next few days while I potentially go through withdrawals. 
He’s not home from work yet (he was unfortunately at work when we called him) and I’m beyond nervous as I don’t know exactly what to expect when he gets home. I imagine he will be extremely supportive and loving overall but mad about all my lying - as I would be if I were in his shoes. 

My doctor has said no matter what ends up happening with all this and my drinking, that I can make an appointment every week if I need to, even if it’s just to chat (I’m in Australia and he doesn’t charge for these appointments which means I’m lucky I can see him as needed). So I have another appointment with him next Friday and I’m really wanting to say to him at that appointment that I’m a week sober. He gave me some hard truths today but I needed to hear them. 

So wish me luck and I really hope in a weeks time I’ll be able to say I’ve been sober for 7 days.",2023-03-03 06:20:33,1677824433
stopdrinking,What the FUCK?!,"My life has absolutely fallen apart since I got sober. At least when I was self medicating I was functional. I was entertaining. I was charming. Now what am? Bored, dumped, and alone. This isn’t how I pictured my journey into sobriety. And they HAVE been verbalized to me to be related. FUCK. OUTTA. HERE!!!",2023-03-03 06:17:03,1677824223
stopdrinking,Started Naltrexone…,"exactly two weeks ago. 
I developed my alcohol addiction about two years ago, and it developed pretty rapidly. Ive since tried to quit over the past year, my longest run being 60 days. I went from occasional social drinking to drinking a bottle of liquor daily, while trying to quit a year in. 
 
(Skip down to question)
Background: I am diagnosed with PTSD, GAD, MDD, ADHD, SH, BPD and body dysmorphia. I’ve been on Wellbutrin,  Effexor and Adderall/Vyvanse for about two years as well. Recently diagnosed 6 months ago with bad PCOS so hopped on hormones and I’m chronically anemic. And I’ve been a daily 420 since I was a teen and I’m now 35. I was removed from my single mother at 6 and grew up in the foster system until I was finally adopted at age 15 by foster parents. Was denied access to ever contact bio family but was told alcoholism, addiction, BD and MDD run rampant in them and my mother OD’d on booze and pills when I was 21. So there’s that, lol.

So back to my original ice breaker… I have gotten to the point where I hit my rock bottom and I had to decide on either in patient recovery or use AA and therapy to get over it on my own. Since I don’t have insurance, self help it is. Prob is I was failing miserably and I was rly scared for myself. I srsly couldn’t even make it two days without giving in and buying a bottle and I was buying prob four or five bottles a week easy. 
So I finally talked to my psych and he put me on Naltrexone. I’m officially two weeks on and I haven’t touched alcohol since starting. 
While I’m a pretty self aware person, I’m still a bit startled that this medication has helped me already so much. Like, I haven’t touched alcohol literally at all. 

Q: Does anyone else have any insight, thoughts, etc in regards to taking this (and any other meds) specifically for an addiction? What are your feels and experience with it? 
Lots of thought running thru my head; damn, I’m on addiction meds or what happens if I stop the meds? Is this really all in my head or am I physically addicted? How the hell does it feel to be drunk but not euphoric at all (I haven’t desired to test it). And wtf have I started smoking cigs again after quitting three years ago? I feel so behind in life and just so defeated. I’m thankful for the medicinal help, but wonder if it’s something I’ll always need for maintenance? 🥺",2023-03-03 06:07:58,1677823678
stopdrinking,Ever been in a situation where you were mocked?,"So this didn't happen to me, this happened to a buddy of mine who damn near drank himself to death and had to spend weeks in the hospital being brought back to life. The doctors straight up told him if he ever drinks again, he was going to die. That said, story below - 

My buddies and I decided to go out to one of our favorite spots to have a few beers and play some card games. My buddy that had been sober for a bit at this point decided to tag along, but he'd never been to this bar (for obvious reasons). When we got there, our favorite waitress came out and took our drink orders. We know her well and she always feels super comfortable around us, so when my sober buddy ordered a soda she immediately started cracking jokes about his manhood. It was super rough, but he handled it with grace and we quickly let her know that she was making her jokes to the wrong person - she rightfully felt awful. 

I'm laying in bed imagining what my future without alcohol will be like and it caused me to reflect on this night. It was a blip on the radar for me then, but I'm realizing really how hard it must have been for him. If I went out to the bar with my friends who were drinking and a pretty girl started making fun of me for not, I'm afraid my pride would take over and I'd end up getting stupid drunk and hating myself for it. We live in a weird society where alcohol abuse isn't just accepted, it's actively encouraged. You'd never make fun of someone for turning down Crack, but alcohol, all day. Very strange. 

Anyway, just wondering if any of you kind folks have similar stories and if so, how'd you (or your friend/family member) handle it?",2023-03-03 06:05:14,1677823514

Every day isn't pretty. I've had some of the darkest times of my life during my sobriety, but it comes with the business of being a human being. But sometimes I think to myself that I need to think more like a dog. 

A dog wakes up every day and sees the same faces, eats the same food, goes on the same walk day after day. But they do it with the upmost enthusiasm. An appreciation for a new day. Just being around the people they love is enough for them.

In my profession, we have to deal with a lot of crazy deadlines which drove me to the bottle in the past. I know I have learned some very difficult lessons from that experience.

Just curious if anyone else has experienced this. I’m slowly getting further diagnosed to better prescribe my meds. Currently I’m taking a non-stimulant version of adderall which causes a lot of nausea and honestly didn’t work at all until I decided to start taking my leftover naltrexone for cravings and the combination somehow works just enough for me to function while we figure ut out",2023-03-03 05:44:06,1677822246
stopdrinking,Escalation,"July 2022 came around, I decided to have a few beers just to numb myself a bit. This is what kickstarted all of this. Next weekend, again another day of drinking. It started off being a few beers here and there sometimes on my days off. “Fuck it, it’s my day off” I’d say. Slowly, I’d start telling myself “I didn’t even get to enjoy my buzz yesterday, let’s do this.” Eat something small real quick and go to town. Then I started having a beer before work, then started to have a few after work, even though I had to go back in the next day. As I still live with my parents, I’ve been hiding it all this time. My father once found me passed out on my keyboard with a tall boy in clear view. Told him I’ll stop, drank the very next day. Maybe they notice I’m off, but don’t want to accept I might be abusing alcohol. It started as 2 - 3 500ml beers, now I’m up to 3 - 5 tall boys 2 - 5 days a week. I’m getting worried. I’m starting to have thoughts like “beer takes too long, what if I get a bottle today?” 

This is escalation. 

Today, I came to terms that this is unacceptable and I need to stop before it gets worse or something happens to my body. No one knows, I’m too ashamed. I don’t really have friends, it would break my parents to know this information. I don’t know how I could let this happen, you tell yourself you’ll be fine, it’s only a few beers. It’s not fine. I feel such great shame that this substance has consumed my life. I have a few tall boys in the fridge. I’m going to pour them all out. Tomorrow starts my journey. I want to be better, I want this vice out of my life. Please wish me luck",2023-03-03 05:36:46,1677821806

I saw that The Tedeschi Trucks Band even has a group of fans trying to start a group called Made Up Minds.

stopdrinking,"The Daily Check-In for Friday, March 3rd: Just for today, I am NOT drinking!","*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

**I Will Not Drink With You Today!**

Fitting that my sober-versary falls on a Friday: my first three sober Fridays were pretty effing intense. I made it by doomscrolling on r/stopdrinking. (Or whatever the happy opposite of doomscrolling is). I read and read and commented and commented and this subreddit powered me along and kept me strong. I just love you guys so much. One guy I love, St Homer, is always looking for a sobernaut (with 30 days) to host the DCI - just shoot him a comment!

So Fridays ... 

Traditionally the day of the week when the party starts and everyone can let their hair down after a long week of work, kids and various crapola. I set myself up with all the orange Crush, Mars bars, and chocolate almonds a middle-aged goofbag could eat, learned from my new friends on r/stopdrinking and had some GD Advil ready. This got me through the joys of physical withdrawals and at the one-month mark I knew I was going to make it because r/stopdrinking taught me that not drinking is an amazing. joyful, life-affirming thing and not a sacrifice, not a sad or depressing state of affairs. It is my life 2.0 and I would sooner pull out a toenail than have a drink.

She got a weird attitude and acted like I was weird for not wanting to drink. 

Finally she said,”Like....good for you but also seems a bit extreme”

stopdrinking,How would that feel?,"Sitting here, nursing an NA beer, I'm surprised that I find myself not really craving alcohol. I guess I just wanted something fizzy to drink and we don't have any pop. I've had quite a change of heart lately, and I'm not quite sure why, but I like it. I feel like all the times I've tried quitting before, I've worked up to it, made a big deal of it, got angry at alcohol, told it to back off, the whole nine. This time, I just... didn't want it anymore. I guess I just haven't really thought of it as ""quitting."" I feel more like I've been around the block enough times to know what every cracking brick on every shitty storefront looks like, and it's time to walk down a different street.

I had a brief moment of ""what-if"" pass through my mind just now, and I answered, truthfully, that if this NA beer had alcohol in it, I'd be in more misery than anyone should ever have to know. More than enough for one lifetime, and plenty after that. I thought about how it would feel to be drunk, and frankly, it's just terrible. All of it. The rotten, sloshing feeling in my head. The stumbling around in my own god damn bathroom. The unfounded, untargeted anger, condescension, and contempt for everything around me, especially myself. Fuck that.

The other day, I wrote in my journal about sitting by a winter fire and drinking a nice, cold porter. How much I'd want that perfect little event to unfold just so... And how it would be just perfect. For five seconds. And then that cold porter would turn into the other five in the box, warm or not, and then some, and I wouldn't give a damn about the fire or the beautiful snow outside anymore and all I would want to feel is that sickly embrace of amnesia and apathy. I would want nothing more than to drink myself into a stupid, angry mess. And, not to speak for others, I think that's how it would really go for many of us here.

For whatever reason, the illusion is gone. The smoke has cleared and the lights have gone up and it's just a feeble old man with a snarl and crooked teeth pulling frayed strings and drawing faded curtains over an empty stage. I just don't want that anymore. I don't want to just ""get through"" another moment of my life. I don't want another second to pass me by in a grey haze and be gone on the breeze. I don't want the moments of my life to come through corroded terminals hooked up to a flickering CRT display anymore. I don't want to spend any more time, energy, money, or emotion on something that will destroy me. I don't want to escape anymore. I want to live.

stopdrinking,TW:Mention of Sexual Assault while drunk,"I'm wondering how common this experience is. Has anyone else gotten black out drunk and woken up to being gang raped by multiple people? It happened to me, and I've seen posts around reddit of it happening to other women. I went on to Google and found an anthropology case study from 1990 about this being a form of male binding for men in fraternities to target drunk women to do this. For me, this happening was really the beginning of a nearly 20-year downward spiral that I'm just now getting out of. You would have thought this would have gotten me to look at my drinking when it happened. Instead, it just deepened my issues with substances. If you've healed from this, how?",2023-03-03 03:17:49,1677813469
stopdrinking,first time posting,"hi — i really admire the vulnerability i see in these posts. and what I love even more is the grace and compassion yall extend in the comment sections. 

I’m 4 days sober. I’m about to turn 28 and after a decade of problematic binge drinking. I’m coming to terms with my alcoholism. When I was 18 I had 3 incidents resulting in me having to get my stomach pumped. I started drinking a lot less after that and was more into smoking weed until I turned 21 then shit went downhill. I moved to nyc for a summer internship then moved there after college graduation and I’ve been here for 6 years. It’s been 6 years of binge drinking. I may not drink every day but I’ve been drinking at least 3-4 times a week. On the weekdays I can have anywhere up to 5 drinks and on the weekends….anything goes. (And especially after I started taking vyvanse — I’m a tank on this medication). And let’s not even talk about all the blow I was doing. 

On the outside I am a very accomplished high performer. And I don’t mean to sound like a show off I’m saying this to highlight that almost no one understands that I have crippling anxiety and I use alcohol to help. Everyone thinks I’m this super social extrovert and I don’t even know if I’m actually an extrovert because without alcohol I kinda wanna crawl in bed and do nothing. I think drinking has made me lose my inner spark so maybe that’s why I’m questioning if I’m an extrovert. 

Alcoholism is genetic and my dad and his side of the family has serious drinking issues. I’m genuinely traumatized from the fights and the horrid experiences I’ve had witnessing my dad and his family be blackout drunk. It also doesn’t help that socially drinking is a huge part of living in NYC. 

Long story short, something clicked in me a few weeks ago where I think I understand that this vicious cycle of anxiety that I am in is honestly perpetuated by alcohol.  My ADHD is 20 times worse and I self sabotage so much while drinking. It’s made me gain a ton of weight and Has honestly contributed to lots of depressive episodes.

I feel a lot of shame with admitting that I have zero self-control when it comes to alcohol. I feel like so jealous of my friends and people who can have two drinks and stop and be completely normal whereas if I have more than two drinks, I’m gonna end up drinking 10 drinks because I can’t stop . Why am I like this?

Not to sound dramatic, but after making alcohol such a big part of my life, what I’m scared about is realizing who I really am without the alcohol. 

I feel like I’m starting from scratch. And I’m just really scared of trying to navigate a sober life. I feel like I need to make a brand new personality. 

Continuing to drink alcohol just feels like it’ll make my life easier even though I know that’s not true but goddamn, I feel so lost. 

Also thanks for reading my stream of consciousness. Sorry if I sound incoherent, I just had a full bag of twizzlers instead of having a beer so the sugar rush is really getting to me",2023-03-03 03:13:21,1677813201
stopdrinking,"Just hit 200, but so many more days to go!","Time has been getting slower and slower for me  as I get more days under my belt, it seems.

I guess all the drinking I did before really did make time go faster. It seems like months ago when I saw I was at 190 days and started trying to think about what to say today. I haven't come up with much in that time though.

However, I dove heavy back into my hobbies though. I learned CNC milling, designed my own circuit board and learned a ton about advanced electronics design, finished a few projects that never seemed to get done for the last couple of years and countless other things.

I have flatlined at +15lbs gained, so that is good. However, there are some lingering health issues that me and my doc are working through. (Thankfully, my heart tests came back OK, so that is nice.) The sugar cravings aren't as bad as they once were, but that comes in waves still.

Unfortunately, but also fortunately, I have more disposable income. I may have bought just a few more things than I have actually needed, but that is OK. I have naturally slowed down on shopping for things though.. I think.

So far, so good. I will not drink with you today.

The next day I got another six pack but only drank four and threw away the remaining two bc that’s when the shame and guilt hit. I felt like I failed myself but what actually caused me to break down was seeing my sister that day and knowing that she basically was the one that saved my life when I asked for help. All she did was bend over backwards to help me when I was detoxing and all she asked was that I promise to not drink again and I did. I feel like I failed the one person that means the world to me and I can’t even bring myself to tell her. Also, if you are thinking of drinking again, don’t. You’ll just feel sick bc it doesn’t feel the same at all after not drinking for a while.

stopdrinking,Alcohol is the true gateway drug.,"First time posting. I’ve been watching the sub on and off for about 7 months but I think I’m ready to find my sense of community here. It’s been 3 days since my last drink, and here’s to more!

Now I am not a daily drinker but when I do I binge which is on a two week schedule at my worst.

I went 2 months without drinking before this and before that 1 month. I was convinced I could moderate but my 4th time drinking I was back to clubbing and sniffing.

Anyway I feel like alcohol is the true gateway drug. I only ever do cocaine after I’ve had a drink. I always have 4 drinks, want to keep the party going, score some blow, and then keep going until the wee hours of the morning and then attempt drink til I pass out due to the rough nature of the comedown.

I don’t think anyone just does heroin after being sober. Or decided hey crack sounds nice. I feel like for most people it starts after a drink, and building that toxic dependence on alcohol, and to “enhance” or counteract the depressant effects of alcohol, they turn to harder drugs in the spirit of the party.

What sucks is I don’t think I can ever moderate my drinking. My brain and body has coupled the two together for so long that an evening out devolves into a binge because it’s been my default setting. It’s beyond drinking too much for me at this point.

And while drinking does drive my behavior I just like going out! That’s what’s difficult. I want to stand around in cute cocktail dresses and have a artisanal lavender side car with the fancy people. But I can’t. And that actually sucks.",2023-03-03 01:35:51,1677807351
stopdrinking,I cried while drinking last night,"Last night, I went through my usual drinking routine. 10+ drinks in one go by myself, chilling, reading, vibing to music... And I had a tough time getting into the flow of it. I didn't enjoy it at all. I remember being 4ish drinks in and thinking ""man, I could stop right now, this isn't gonna be worth it""

But I kept drinking till I finished all the drinks I'd bought. Wasn't a very fun night.

I ended up breaking down crying on my couch, sobbing into my pillow, feeling weak in my entire body.

What exactly triggered it, I'll keep to myself. But I realized how much damage I'm really doing to my well-being and happiness by getting drunk so often, and that hit me hard. Still, I'm happy I had that emotional release. Crying once in a while doesn't make me any less of a man.

I've been feeling pretty numb and ""meh"" overall these days. I hate socializing. I'm not feeling fired up to work on projects I normally enjoy. Don't know if drinking has anything to do with it. But going to the gym always gets me feeling better, and I think getting over this feeling is just a matter of finding more actionable things to do that get me feeling happier.

Don't know if this time, I'll make good on wanting to be fully sober, but I'll make my decisions day by day.",2023-03-03 01:28:57,1677806937

stopdrinking,Realizing my parents are pretty horrible people overall,"It's no wonder myself, my sister, and my brother are all kind of messed up. 

For the past year or so ive really been starting to see things as they are. I think I used to compensate a lot, because I would constantly feel the need to tell people how great my parents are as I was growing up. Honestly we were just poor, and I was aware enough even young to understand that, so I assumed since we're poor and not homeless, then my parents must be very hard working respectable people. And I painted that picture for a long time 

I've been living at home for two years now. Soon to be out as the savings account is getting where it needs to be, as is my head. I've slowly been noticing things that just aren't okay. I guess when I moved out a while back, I got a taste of what life is like outside this family, and it was a completely different story. 

""I'll put your head through a wall"" is apparently not a normal threat to make to a kid, in fact threatening your kids isn't a parenting tactic at all. ""parents sometimes fight"" doesn't mean constant, every day yelling and screaming. A lot of the things I was taught growing up are just plain wrong. Lies about history, and the world. I uncover more and more the more I think about it. 

Dad drunkenly threatening/trying to fight the entire neighborhood to the point I had to call my uncle to come get him isn't a funny story at all now looking back, it's embarrassing. No dad I'm not proud of you for that, it was stupid. 

Talking to other people about their lives really revealed a lot to me. How a lot of this stuff isn't really normal at all. Making a kid go pick their own whip from a willow tree before hitting them with it isn't normal, it's cruel. Smacking a kid at minimum on a weekly basis, and then telling other parents you never smack their kid isnt just not starting trouble, it's lying. Mom getting mad when you get a bruise playing with friends cause you're scared what the teachers might say is not being cautious, it's having a guilty conscious. 

Terrified of failure. Heightened anxiety. Not feeling safe in public. Isolative tendencies. Lack of impulse control. Alcohol abuse. Anger issues. There's a part of me that's starting to put pieces together. 

I hate it because I love these people, but the more I speak to them I'm starting to hate them, again. I hated being home when I was younger. I forced myself to get over everything in order to make things work. I never wanted to be that guy who hates his parents, I wanted that perfect life. And I was willing to sacrifice quite a lot for it. Honestly I just don't think it's there. Having to make shit up to get a decent story to reminisce on isn't going to cut it. They do that a lot too, fabricate these little stories of stuff that never happened. ""remember how we always used to.."" 

No actually I don't remember that. I have zero clue what you're talking about. Talk about shit that didn't even happen. 

When I get the money together and get out of here, if houses could just chill tf out for a bit, I'm heavily considering burning this bridge. It feels selfish to still live here with that in the back of my mind but I don't think this is a burden I need to carry anymore. I don't HAVE to love anyone. Im not the one that has to make this son to parent relationship work. I'm a grow man now, and if I'm ever blessed in a way to have a kid or two I'm not gonna treat their soul, heart, and mind like a toy.",2023-03-03 01:25:16,1677806716

stopdrinking,"the ""gray area"" and best ways to stop","Here's the situation: I drink wine every day. Somewhere between 2 and 5 (I know) glasses over many several hours (say, between 5:00 PM and 12:00). I do feel more relaxed, it's easier to laugh (I'm usually too anxious to have fun) and the flavor is pleasant. The easiest way to stop is by going to bed, if I'm awake and there's more, I'll probably have more. 

I know that's too much alcohol. But also: I don't get drunk; I don't get hangovers; I don't have black outs. Also, if I'm out of wine but there's, say, rum or whiskey in the house, I feel sad and disappointed about the lack of wine and obsess a little but never go for the liquor as a substitute. So I want alcohol but not enough to drink something I don't like. And I only like a few things. I like some beers and not others, and would not drink the others even if I'm really longing for a drink. 

I've heard the phrase ""gray area"", I guess that's where I'm at? Problematic drinking, maybe some addiction, that is not full blown alcoholism but could become that?

That's the first question. The second and main one: if any of you were daily drinkers who cut back on drinking, did you do it cold turkey or tried some other approach? If I do it cold turkey, will my body rebel, because it's used to it by now?",2023-03-02 23:26:46,1677799606

I'm fore damn sure done. I relapsed on a whim not because I craved it, but because I got it by random chance and was so desperate for anything to turn my brain that I tried it. 

Turns out, I did a sleep study, I wake up about 20 times a night not realizing it, gasping for air, and having a dry mouth. My results show severe sleep apnea. I am literally getting very little REM sleep which explains why I hated sleeping, I'm forgetting everything, my senses are heavily impaired and increasingly so, and my attention span is shit. 

I'll be starting a CPAP study next to get setup for one.

I am hoping this is the answer I needed and I knew I wasn't crazy. 

Doctors legit wrote me off the 20 or so times I went, told me I was just depressed, no issues, cycled through a ton of mess with nothing working, and the only result I've ever got was from a random sleep study (WHICH I DID THE RESEARCH ON AND RECOMMENDED TO THEM) and after I was made to wait several months, this is the 1st answer I've ever gotten from a million tests, and this is a huge one. 

Knew I wasn't crazy, inquire about things, it's OK to get 2nd opinions, even if medical practices have policies against it. I respect them and I do believe medicine is fantastic. However, be proactive in your health and consider other factors too. Just don't become a hypochondriac like I did.

In other news I just got extended a job offer to be a banker and I have accepted, despite my brain literally being so close to mush that even emailing someone or reading something simple takes me about 5 times to understand.

Hoping and praying the CPAP machine is the answer. 

I was drinking a bottle a day or more generally before bed, and I blame alcohol for causing this, never had any of these issues before. 

Be proactive with your health, trust the science, trust your doctors, but there is nothing wrong with seeking 2nd opinions or questioning things.

stopdrinking,Triggers,"Hi all,

Almost a week out from a very bad binge.

The extreme terror of the immediate aftermath seems to be receding - I can remember what happiness can feel like.

I am trying to journal something here (and elsewhere) regularly to keep the issue front of mind.

I have been a problem drinker from the beginning, but having recognised the issue at some point, my pattern for the last seven or eight years is to have long periods without a drink then a single incident of appalling drunkenness, which starts the process again.

Before last weekend, I had a stretch of more than 12 months without an incident of drunkenness.  

However, in the lead up, I had been allowing myself to have one, two or three drinks in particular circumstances (without coming to harm on those occasions).

As previously, I chose to interpret these as indicators of growth.

I recognise now that these merely paved the way for a binge later in time.

I am somebody who can never engage with alcohol in a risk free way.  The next drink I have will lead me on a path to destruction, whether on that occasion or some later one.

I have no desire to drink right now, and I am comfortable that I can get a decent stretch of time going before a drink seems appealing.

Below are some triggers I must be mindful of at three/six/12 months (and hopefully beyond):

-being annoyed by prompts to engage with alcohol tracking/peer support apps on phone;

-disengaging or deviating from routines set up to maintain AF motivation;

-being annoyed by offer of AF beer;

-feeling nostalgic for or idealising having a drink;

-feeling distant from the issue of my problem drinking;

-feeling that I have come to some lasting solution to my problem drinking;

-feeling accomplished and in control generally; and

-feeling restless and dissatisfied with my life generally and my marriage in particular.",2023-03-02 22:20:03,1677795603

stopdrinking,Day 2.,"2 days! I was sober from in 2020-2021..I started socially drinking believing I could handle it, and then the social drinking turned into drinking ""socially"" nearly every weekend. I can feel it taking a toll, the recovery days are taking longer, and I can see the difference on my skin and face. I've never felt or looked better than in that years time of sobriety. I am not someone who drinks daily, and I just do so to unwind and socialize out at clubs/bars... but I now realize that is an addiction just the same.. and when I do go out and start, I dont stop until 4 am. I am now addressing this issue, and Im not sure where to start. I've downloaded ""Sober Time"", and found this support group. I suppose this is just my first post for the point of making one after joining. Excited to start this journey.",2023-03-02 22:02:50,1677794570
stopdrinking,Newly sober... the grief process,"I haven't introduced myself here yet although I've checked in on the daily thread for the last two days. I've been an alcoholic for 17 years. Ive been sober for 3 days. This is the first time I've realized the need to surrender to a life of total sobriety. 

I'm struggling with a feeling that I can only compare to when a person has died. I can't shake the looming sense of grief and I don't know how to do what I need to do. I have to take care of my kids and still function... It's like when there's a death and you have those moments where you stop crying and someone says something that makes you laugh... And you feel almost guilty. I'm all fucking over the place. 

I have a deep realization about the pain I've already caused and I feel like I can't put on the act anymore and I don't want to hurt anyone around me any further. I don't know how to take space or care for myself because I've never loved myself in my life. 

How do I compartmentalize this? I'm so overwhelmed. I'm meeting with a recovery counselor to help me get into an appropriate out patient program and I'm hooking into a non religious recovery meeting on zoom tonight. 

I guess I just need somewhere to place my feelings. I know my decision is solid because I feel like there's been a huge change. It just feels scary and unfamiliar. I don't know who I am and I don't believe I ever have. I'm not sorry to see her go, but I sure as shit don't know how to act or react since I no longer have the lie and the act of being ""functional"" to rely on. 

I'm only 3 days into this. I've been spending the last 2 years using ""self control"" as my excuse to keep drinking. I don't have to tell any of you that story... It's been told and told. Never in my life have I surrendered. I do now and holy shit this is the hardest thing I've ever done in my life, but I'm done running. 

I'm experiencing grief on a serious level. I welcome advice on how to cope and interact with my family and to still do what I need to do in the midst of these emotions.

stopdrinking,Reflection after 69 days sober,"I sat at my table this morning staring at my liquor cabinet while drinking coffee. In the back of my mind, I could hear a whisper of the old me saying “go ahead, it’s a celebratory day, have a glass.”

I smiled at my reflection in those well-used glass paned doors and shook my head. I’ve come too far and accomplished so much to have that little voice tell me that it was okay to do it. I sipped my coffee knowing that I wasn’t going to have that drink and kinda chuckled to myself that 70 days ago I would have torn that cabinet open and downed a whole bottle of whiskey and not had a second thought about it. 

I washed my coffee cup out, reset the machine for my wife and headed out to work. How was I going to celebrate this massive milestone of my sobriety?? With the dirtiest bacon pancakes and chilli maple syrup I could find. 

I never forget that I did this to myself, both being an alcoholic and taking the path to sobriety. 

To this, I raise my coffee mug to all of you and say Thank you, I will not drink with you today.

I managed to screw this up over the weekend and got caught. Fortunately, the house manager was kind enough to take mercy on me and not kick me out straightaway. I have to redo a bunch of therapy + start attending even more meetings, but it's a small price to pay for not getting booted.

Oof. I just feel like such a shithead. Actually the part that hurt the most was also the part that made me feel kind of good - the house manager said ""I know there's a part of you that wants this. And I think you have so much to offer our recovery community."" Damn. 

Anyway. I'm not looking for hugs or affirmations or advice or anything, I just needed to get this out there. I can't really discuss it with anyone in my house or my family - I'm just not comfortable doing so and I know they would either secretly judge/be reluctant to interact with me (house ppl) or just be super disappointed and upset (family). I'll be able to discuss and work through it with my counselor and recovery coach later, I just wanted to get it off my chest for today.

stopdrinking,Got out of jail 5 days ago,"Was in there for 74 days, and it was the most agonizing and traumatic experience of my life, which is saying a lot. Got drunk my first night out and had a bad time that scared me away from substances for 5 days, but here I am again tonight - drunk and alone.

I've struggled with lifelong severe social anxiety issues and I feel like it's a battle I'm just never going to win. I've alienated everyone in my life and I spend most of my days obsessing over either my fitness progress (physical attractiveness being the only thing I feel I'm capable of offering anyone) or feeling tears well up in my eyes as I sadly reminisce over the few romantic affairs I've had in my life - girls who seemed to love and accept me until they got to know the real me. And who now view me as a worthless degenerate, wanting nothing to do with me.

I've been to rehab a few times and I seemed unable to function in that kind of social environment, in a way that no one else seemed to. I ran into someone from rehab at the gym my first day out who I always thought was kinda cool, and who I share a bit in common with. He's 16 months sober and there was mutual interest in going to AA meetings together, but I've never been to one outside of rehab. The religious stuff in AA has always made me feel alienated and I just feel like I'm too socially inept to benefit from that kind of environment anyway. Honestly I feel like I'm too socially inept to function...anywhere. I ruminated over how awkward I was during our encounter and that was a big reason why I decided to get drunk that night.

No longer being on probation + medication adjustments should help me feel like I have a new lease on life, but I feel almost as hopeless and suicidal as ever.",2023-03-02 21:11:04,1677791464
stopdrinking,Weekend binger here. Weekend is coming up. Tips and advice are welcome.,"I've binged on weekends for about 20 years now. Have managed to keep it almost exclusively on weekends and sometimes even only one night. I don't drink at all during the week. I had a beer left over after my Saturday night binge and it has sat in my fridge all week. I am not even tempted until Friday night.

&amp;#x200B;

Friday night... it's like somebody else takes over my body. I go to the store and get a six-pack +1 (because on the nights when a 6-pack isn't enough, that +1 stops me from going to the store for another six-pack)

&amp;#x200B;

During the week, I am the picture of health and discipline. I go to bed early, wake up early, get some exercise, do my chores, work, and do all manner of responsible productive things. I eat well and take care of my body.

&amp;#x200B;

But it's like something flips a switch inside my head. When Friday rolls around it's like it grabs me and won't let go. I don't even do anything ""fun"" like go out. I just sit at home and read and get so drunk that I can hardly focus on the page. I'll stay up hours past my normal bedtime, just to make sure that I get my drunk on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah. The hangovers suck. Sometimes I'll have a headache. Mostly I just feel dumb the next day. Like my brain is working in slow motion.

The end of the quarter is coming and I’m really close to being screwed. I’ve missed some days, one due to actual illness and one because I was too hungover, which I need to make up. I don’t have much time, because of drinking (and a crazy busy schedule but drinking sure doesn’t help), so what do I do? Keep drinking of course. 

I have so many great opportunities. I’m such a capable and smart person who can do so much. And I’m just wasting it. I don’t want to, I want to be this amazing person I know I can be. But I just throw it away with alcohol. 

I got wasted last night, after stacking up three days sober which is a good run for me, and I’m so mad and I feel like crap. I didn’t take a shower. My mouth tasted like beer. I somehow made my two hour commute. I had a presentation today that I spent time on but just half assed in person. I feel so dull and dumb. I need my brain to work! I have a bunch of work shit to do and I just don’t care. Despite the fact that I have an evaluation tomorrow.

When I’m drinking I just muster up enough of me to make it through the day. I’m sure it shows. It’s embarrassing. It’s negatively effecting everything. I’ve been loving my sober days. I have motivation, I can get shit done, I feel good. And the sleep!

I’m really down on myself today. Irony being, the amazing part of me interviewed really well and just got this amazing opportunity for next year. I’m stoked.

stopdrinking,Aaaaand...reset.,"Yesterday I was listening to The Naked Mind audiobook and then ... I paused it and ordered box wine.  Ugh.  The self loathing was definitely strong when I hit that ""submit order"" button.  At first it was fun/relaxing (oh, sweet dopamine) and of course, as it usually goes, I drank way too much and woke up feeling like trash in so, so many ways.  I had decided I needed to rein it in about a week ago after being a rum fool.  I've been a ""problem drinker"" since high school, I'm 32 now.  I was sober when I was pregnant with my daughter, and thought maybe that'd be a ""reset"".  She was born fall of 2021 and initially I did a couple glasses of wine here or there, but eventually it devolved into binge drinking multiple times a week.  I don't do regrettable things every time I drink, but everything I've done in my life that I feel guilty about are things I did while drunk.  I absolutely self-medicate anxiety etc with alcohol, and alcohol absolutely makes my anxiety worse in the long haul.  I need to do better &amp; be better.  My daughter deserves me at my best.

stopdrinking,The anniversary of When I Almost Died (and got sober instead),"It's not my one year sobriety anniversary because I slipped this last summer for about 3 weeks, but it is the most important anniversary for when I was forced out my alcoholic hole. Cheers all, IWNDWYT

[Actually, I made a post here about it once I was six days sober](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/t9mnsv/day_6_feeling_great_but_got_here_in_a_stupid_and/)

**TL;DR: I moved to a remote wilderness location and went cold turkey. Suffered withdrawal symptoms in isolation without medical care, almost lost my partner, and my life. whew!**

One year ago today, I finished moving into a small dorm-like apartment in the middle of a National Park, where I accepted a job as kitchen staff for a remote wilderness education center. I applied for, and accepted the position, because my life was in shambles and I was making a desperate move to ""get some space and move forward."" 

My partner and I had been attempting to taper down and quit drinking for over a year; actively abusing it for around 3 years, and problem-drinking for much longer than that. In retrospect, I've had difficulties with drinking the moment I started at age 16. Leading up to my move to the mountains, we threw tapering out the window and had a full week-long bender. We drank and fought and drank. By the end of it my partner was vomiting blood (which she did often by that point). I demanded we go to the ER; she refused. I angrily forced her to come along on the hungover car ride our friend gave me to the Park. 

The plan, at least for me, was to use this job as a way to get space from her and get sober. I was going to work four days on, three days off, and spend those three day weekends back in town with her. We were in an incredibly toxic and destructive place, but our relationship hadn't always been like that. She thought I was leaving her; I thought I needed to do this to save our relationship, and get it back to where it had been before the drinking got so bad. Anyone here who's been in the black pit of the alcoholic cycle knows... it had gotten very bad.

In any case, I knew I needed to taper off the bender, so I brought a pint of gin with me to the National Park. I wrote a schedule of drinks to make it last my first four days. Because I arrived before most of the seasonal employees, I found myself alone at the wilderness center that first night. Instead of enjoying the extreme solitude that I'd been *craving,* I drank the entire pint and got *wasted.*

Leading to the worst case scenario- the next day I started training, deeply hungover and entering withdrawal, surrounded by strangers who had no idea, without access to a vehicle, 75 minutes from the nearest town (and liqour store), and 90 minutes from the nearest hospital. This was an extreme cold turkey, as I basically went from 12-15 drinks of straight gin a day, for the last week, to *nothing*. 

It was bad. Thinking about it makes my guts shrivel into knots. I was shaking and sweating so badly I could hardly walk; I'm sure I looked pale and feverish and strange. It felt like actively dying. Again, aynone who's been through the withdrawal... knows.... I lasted as long as I could through training and then excused myself ""to go walk some trails."" I went straight to my shitty new bed in the dorm and laid there with tremors and auditory hallucinations. I was extremely sure that if I did not find a way to drink more alcohol I was going to have a seizure and die. I had constant head-to-toe chills, waves of nuasea, and panic. 

But, I survived that day, and the next day, when I was most terrified of a seizure. I hardly slept, and sat in my dorm building very slowly put a puzzle together. I think by the end of that next day I was able to eat half a bowl of oatmeal. It was just so stupid, every part of it. I asked for no help, had no vitamins or extra fluids, did no tapering, and had my eyes glued to google as I tried to determine where I was on the withdrawal timeline. Also, my partner and I were in such a bad place that I did not tell her any of what was happening. 

By day 4, I knew I was going to live and was through the worst. Honestly I couldn't believe it, as I also had not been sober for 4 days straight in *years.* That afternoon, through the fuzzy wifi of the wilderness center, our close friend called to tell me she was currently driving my partner to the ER. 

I don't know exactly how things went for her those couple days after I moved to the Park, but apparently at some point she had called our friend and asked to come over and crash. She ended up throwing up blood at our friend's house, and having an emotional breakdown. I don't know exactly what clicked, but this time, our friend said, she was ready to get medical help. 

I arranged a ride back to town for my first three-day-weekend, by which time my partner had been moved from the ER to the ICU for medical detox. I couldn't visit her, but we talked on the phone, and I talked her through some of the worst of her withdrawal symptoms. Even with the IV drips and medicine, she suffered extreme hallucinations and DTs. I ended up extending that weekend for a couple weeks, to ease my partner out of the hospital and back into our new sober reality.

And ease myself into it too. ""Raw-dogging reality"" is such a fun and real phrase, when you go from alcoholism to trying to live without that numbing viel. 

In the end I worked up in the mountains for 3 months, eventually cutting the season short due to some staffing shortages. And, because by that point I no longer needed the dramatic space from my partner and life, and the weekly commute was more trouble than it was worth. I moved back in with my partner; here we are a year later, still together, and both still sober. 

When she looks at me now, she is really there, looking at me. When I see myself in the mirror now, there are clear, intelligent eyes looking back. I'm so fucking grateful to have my mind back, my health back, and my ability to love back. Alcohol was a strangehold.

Yay, I feel great. I just got out of jail and I'm working on getting all my alcohol classes started, community service enrolled, and getting my driving privileges back! I'm eligible for early reinstatement as long as I have a blow 'n go installed in my vehicle, which I just got a few days ago and scheduled an appointment with the DMV. 

I'm sitting in the parking lot right now after passing the written test, paying all the fines, and just the overall ""blah"" experience of the DMV. They said my license is suspended (obviously) but it's being held by another state. It turns out said state never received proof of having an interlock the first time around and won't allow reinstatement in another state. I'm like what?! This is over a decade old.

So now I'm trying to get proof of something that happened ages ago. Honestly no idea how I was able to renew my license just a year ago if this was still floating around.

I basically just wanted to vent. Everything has been going great so far, and it just sucks that my actions from a decade ago are still haunting me. Hopefully it can be resolved with a few phone calls.

I also have bipolar and while drinking makes me feel better in the moment, but the hangovers were getting too bad. 

But since I've quit drinking, I obviously feel better on days that I would have otherwise had a hangover, but the majority of the time I'm just as tired and my mood is about the same as before. I was hoping I would look and feel healthier, but it feels the same. Damned if I do, damned if I don't.

I know a lot of folks who are sober and it feels like most of them are really thriving. It's frustrating that I'm not seeing a ton of these benefits, and it's been the reason I've repeatedly gone back to drinking after every extended attempt at quitting.

This would be our first get together with me sober in the last 10 years. My sibling and Father are both what I would call alcoholics. 

They promised and such to keep it light, not be pushy, etc, but even still, I have declined the trip. My sibling even said they'd stay sober the entirety if that is what I required. But I don't believe them. 

I just have a lot of dark memories of the family, and alcohol. Is it normal to *still* not feel ready yet? I really don't know if I'll ever be ready to spend time with them like that again. I'm not sure if I even want to be in contact with them sometimes.

stopdrinking,Just lost my job.,"I just got laid off for reasons I’m extremely mad about. A big injustice has been done to me by a middle manager POS with a grudge. I’ve never in my life been laid off for “performance” reasons, and now suddenly I got dinged for a ton of minor stuff (fellow engineers—the main complaint he raised was “violation of the variable naming conventions,” I kid you not) that cropped up overnight. He soured on me after I *very mildly* critiqued the new processes he put in place, and took it as me threatening his domain.

I’ve had many jobs in my field under my belt. I’ve excelled at all of them. I’m very easy to work with, and have a small ego. Never had a complaint on my end until suddenly this happens. Part of me is thankful that I’m sober and able to face this with a clear head instead of stewing in alcoholic depression, as I know I am talented at what I do. But the other side of me wants to go get a few tall boys and sink into oblivion until unemployment runs out. 

I know I won’t do it. But the anger is intense. I could use a few words of encouragement. I rarely cry, and the fact that this sad, unimportant man is who caused me to feel as worthless as I do right now fills me with rage.

stopdrinking,Something changed,"Hi All! I posted about this back in 2021 - my brother suddenly passed away in October 2020 and I was drinking every day after his death. When I say that I was drinking every day, I was drinking about 3 drinks every night after work and not drinking to blackout - but drinking to numb emotions. In the summer of 2021, I recognized this was becoming a problem and I posted here to get support (and of course the community was completely supportive). I took about a month off and the started my nightly 3 drinking routine again. I'd have breaks here and there, but I was drinking on more days than I wasn't. This led to a 30 pound weight gain and just an overall sluggish feeling. I used to be an endurance athlete (ironman triathlons) so the weight gain has not been pleasant. 

But since then, something has changed. Back in January of this year, every day that I drank, I would have crippling anxiety for the entire next day. I am not someone who has ever dealt with anxiety or depression so this was a new feeling for me. The first time it happened, I didn't even connect with alcohol and just assumed I was having a bad day. But then it kept happening and I was able to connect it to drinking. That switched something in my brain for me - why should I keep drinking if I keep getting anxiety? So I stopped again and this time, it feels different. It feels like it can stick. I think there are a few reasons for this. First, I can connect anxiety with alcohol, which gives me a clear reason to NOT drink. Second, my husband also kind of fell down the spiral with me after my brother died, so he also quit with me. Third, I read Alcohol Explained and it's helped me better understand the physiological effects of drinking that I had not considered before. It's hard for me to ""unknow"" some of the physiological effects now. 

Last week I was around 2 weeks sober and went on a hiking trip that I do every year with friends. And every year we have wine and beer after the hike. This time I came prepared with some NA beers as I was nervous I would be tempted to drink. I'm happy to report that I didn't have any issues with temptation and felt great after that trip - it's like I practiced exercising my sober muscle and I came out stronger. 

I'm on Day 20 and feeling great and will continue not drinking as I don't want to deal with crippling anxiety for something I did to myself. Hope you all are having a wonderful day and thanks for reading.",2023-03-02 17:42:10,1677778930

I am SO so so sick right now. I feel like if this doesn't force me to quit, what will. I quit for two years, why is it so hard to get back on the wagon now?

It's easy to convince myself that binge drinking once a week isn't alcoholism but it definitely is. If I had been sober I would have ran out of that bar so fast at the first hint of a sneeze. Or, you know, even better - I wouldn't have been there.

I began writing and realized what a therapeutic feeling it gave me to finally admit what I’ve been doing for so long, even if it’s just to strangers on the internet. So the post is longer than I originally intended. 

I (30m) spent the last 18+ months letting my drinking get out of control. 

When the pandemic hit in spring 2020 I was just a social drinker. I was the type who could buy a 12 pack of Coors Light and it would last me a month or more. But over the course of the next nearly 3 years, my drinking slowly began to spiral to where I am now. 

In that 3 year span, I began to turn to alcohol for everything. Got a promotion at work? Drinks to celebrate! Grandpa passed away? Drinks to mourn! Sports are on TV? Drinks to watch! 

Before I knew it, I was drinking every single day. I’d drink between 5-10 beers/seltzers every day, without stopping. I’d start early in the day, usually around 9am, and have a steady buzz through the day until about 3pm. But then I’d stop because I knew I had to be a parent and husband to my family when they got home to my family who didn’t know that I was drinking so much so often. 

In an 18 month period I had maybe 10 days total where I didn’t drink at least 1 alcoholic beverage. And never strung more than 2 days in a row together. 

But thanks to lurking this subreddit and reading your stories of strength and determination, I decided it was time for me to make a real and lasting change before I got to the point of needing medical intervention to help me quit. 

I made my first attempt to stop on Wednesday February 22nd. I made it to Saturday the 25th and I broke down and had a couple drinks. I started again the next day and am now on day 5 of not drinking - which is the longest I’ve gone sober in at least 2 years. 

The worst symptom I’m having is the migraines. They are knock-you-on-your-ass strong and have been occurring the last couple days. 

I’m just trying to tell myself that they will go away and this is just a sign that my body is adjusting back to life without alcohol. I feel like if I reverse psychology myself into believing the pain is a good thing, maybe they’ll be more tolerable to push through. 

I’m not sure how to wrap this up, and I am sorry for using this post as a sort of vent therapy. So I’ll just end it by saying that I don’t know what tomorrow holds, but I do know that I will make it through today without drinking, and if you’re struggling to stop, #IWNDWYT",2023-03-02 16:28:03,1677774483

stopdrinking,This year just keeps getting worse.,"So, I spent I a lot time with my grandma growing up, she was important to me. As of yesterday morning she has passed after 3 years of having been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. 

She also had suffered liver cirrhosis from years back that I was made aware of this year, which prevented her from taking certain medicine and in the end her ability to both swallow and digest food stopped completely which then lead to her passing in her sleep 1st of march at 05:15 am.

I ugly cried my eyes out yesterday, now I'm in a state of numbness probably until the funeral later this month. 

Despite this being the worst out of all the bad shit that this year has had... I don't feel like drinking this feeling away. This is something that has to be dealt with properly.

stopdrinking,I relapsed so you don't have to,"I broke 55 days of sobriety on Sunday. I posted here about it and I was optimistic that it was a one-time thing and I could get right back on the wagon.

Well, yesterday, I was out at lunch and everyone was ordering drinks. Without thinking I ordered a glass of wine. Then another and another. Then on the way home I picked up another bottle and a six pack of seltzers. I got near black out and apparently invited a friend over, then immediately passed out when he got here. Had to apologize for that today. I barely remember what I said or did but I know I got into some stupid fight with my partner and ordered a bunch of crappy food.

Then I had a night of terrible sleep, anxiety, nausea and fast heartbeat.

This morning I logged everything I ate and drank because I've been on a weight loss/health journey. Predictably, I was far over my calorie limit and the app let me know if I did this every day I'd gain the same amount of weight I'm trying to lose by this summer.

I also took a look at what I spent. The lunch was paid for by someone else. But the alcohol I bought on the way home was around 40 dollars, and I ordered 75 dollars worth of pizza. So around 115 bucks for a day I barely remember and a morning of regret.

I've heard over and over again from sober people that the easiest thing to do is just not get the first drink. If I hadn't drank on Sunday I wouldn't have been so quick to drink again yesterday. And if I'd managed to not order that first drink yesterday I wouldn't have had to deal with everything I just described.

Stay vigilant, people. I thought I could have a lapse and then get back to sobriety, but it's not that easy.

I haven’t been asked the question “so are you REALLY never going to drink again?” in over a year. Everybody used to ask me that all the time and it drove me crazy. I think that my sobriety has finally become normal to my friends and family. My husband is sober too, which honestly makes our marriage pretty chill. And I went back to school and graduated with a bachelors degree. Now I’ve picked up a ton of hobbies and spend my time cruising through life and doing things that I love.

stopdrinking,9 Months Today,"And here is where I am at.....

I was a social binge drinker who didn't need alcohol to socialize but it was all that I knew since I was 13 so it was all I wanted.  I was never comfortable with my true self so I felt it ideal to mask with the numbing effect. My household was not violent but there was some trauma experienced in my life. I buried it deep and played everything out to a somber beat of what I thought was a fun drum of travel, drinks, success, military career, degrees, great job and great husband. 

The good stuff came eventually but for 3 decades I partied too hard and had some really questionable relationships with people whether romantic or friendship. No need to dwell there. But relationships was always a struggle. Still. 

I have never been sober this long. Ever. I am sleeping better. I am eating better. I have not lost that magic number of pounds everyone else experienced but I feel lighter. I still crave to have that escape sip. But I can turn away easier. I do get bored and lonely because I really have no clue what I evenlike to do. I am home alot. I work from home too. I have redecorated the house and really am spending time with myself to get to know me better. 

I paid off my car, am making more money, in a new position now, cut a few people off, family too, by setting boundaries that I never would say no to. I also cleared up some liver levels that were a little concerning. 

I don't miss drinking. But I do miss escaping. I want to keep going. I want to look back in a year and read this post and not still feel so bored and more things that excited me that end in ""ing"" like crafting, boating, gardening but for now the one thing that really gives me pleasure is working, binging (tv), exercising (walking) and relaxing.

stopdrinking,Day Two &amp; Feeling Extremely Nervous,"I’m sorry to keep posting in here - this is my third in about 24 hours - but right now I have so much nervous energy I can barely sit still.  

I’ve been in active recovery since November 2021, when I got a DUI &amp; entered an outpatient treatment program.  I stayed sober until April 2022 &amp; relapsed through June.  After that, I reentered the program.  But, I’ll admit something I’ve never told anyone - I never really stopped drinking.  I just cut back &amp; tried to drink at less obvious times.  I was called out &amp; questioned here &amp; again, but never actually ""caught.""  Things got really bad again in January, when I switched from wine to vodka. This weekend, I started drinking Sunday night &amp; didn’t stop until after midnight Wednesday. I don’t remember much of Monday or Tuesday. I verbally attacked an ex via text, fought with my parents, fought with some random guy from high school on Facebook for the whole world to see, showed up to work wasted, had two doctors appointments I barely remember - driving myself all over town drunk.  I came completely unhinged. 

I am miserable. I hate what my life has become. I feel so guilty &amp; ashamed. I don’t know how I will ever make things right. I went to my first AA meeting last night &amp; I will reach out to a few of the women who gave me their numbers so that I can stay connected to them between meetings. I’ve been talking to my mom yesterday &amp; today. I apologized to my ex after I sobered up, but I’m sure I’ll never hear from him again.  There’s just so much going on right now &amp; I am a bundle of nerves. I know after drinking like I did for almost three days straight that the anxiety is tied to the alcohol leaving my system &amp; my brain recalibrating.  But, I hate this feeling.  I hate making the same mistakes over &amp; over.  I just want to get well &amp; stay well.  I want peace for myself &amp; my family. I want to be forgiven. I’m so desperate for resolution that I am miserable.  I just want things to be okay. I want to be sober.  I want my family to be safe &amp; happy. I feel like such a loser with an empty life. I just want to be well. I’m so sorry I ever started drinking again. It’s ruined my life - and I keep allowing it. I’m just so sad &amp; nervous. I’m scared I’ll never be well.

stopdrinking,First Business Trip Sober,"It went…. fine. Still figuring out how to navigate things. It really pisses me off that trying to say, “nah I’m fine” is always met with resistance. Every goddamn time. And then, when I get tired of it, I say something like “I just kinda liked drinking too much” or “yeah I just stopped cause it wasn’t a good thing for me” everyone bends over backwards to act like they weren’t just harassing me about having “just one”. 

Being a recovering alcoholic isn’t like being a recovering drug addict. No one supports you. My best fucking friend, who was the first person who actually told me “dude, you ARE an alcoholic” responded with snark when I told him a couple days ago. “I get it you’re so superior….. ugh”. Like, why the fuck can’t people just be cool about it?

This idea that “no one gives a shit” is completely dependent on the context, people, or situation. Hasn’t been my experience at all. But honestly it’s turning my “I’m not drinking today attitude into more of a “I’m not drinking ever because fuck all y’all motherfuckers who don’t support me being healthy and trying not to ruin my life”. Maybe the difference is that I’m one of those guys who never acted a fool when drunk. Never hit rock bottom. I was just the fun guy who was always down to stay out. Fuck me for realizing that it was going to EVENTUALLY ruin my life but didn’t yet. Guess I should have kept going till I got that DUI or my wife left me or I got fired or I fucked my health forever. 

Yea this is a pure, unadulterated rant. It’s just so frustrating hearing about other people getting support, not shit, about being sober. I want that.

Despite the year off and now at three months alc-free, I smoked weed every single night after work. I was in denial that it was causing me any issues. I realized I was using marijuana similarly to alcohol — would spend all weekend high as could be, lazy, watching tv, not cleaning my house or exercising my dog (or myself!). I’m definitely in the camp that weed is much safer and better than alcohol, but I don’t believe it works for me any longer 

I am on day five of no weed and this is what I’ve discovered: 
- I wake up feeling SUPER refreshed
- I’m studying every morning from 5-8 before work for an aws dev cert and am able to retain most of the information 
- My mind is sooo much more clear, attitude is better, and don’t feel as “down” as I normally do 
- dreams are VIVID 


I hated having to give weed up… “they took my alcohol from me, I must have one vice” I’d say…. It absolutely sucks to realize I’m such an addict I literally can’t have one mind-altering substance in my system. Getting used to living this way won’t be easy, but I can already tell it’s worth it.

All evidence of it save the scraps you've desperately clung to will vanish from existence and you will be left wondering if you made it all up.

stopdrinking,feeling miserable feels normal............," 

This might seem like a weird post just wondering if anyone else has issues dealing with the same. I have been diagnosed with a mood disorder some years ago. I have since a teen used alcohol as a medication to deal with trauma and feelings and its has progressed into adulthood.

Every so often I will get my lifestyle habits etc in order and quit alcohol, get exercise and dietary changes, it will last for days to weeks and I will start to feel energetic and alive again. The weird thing is i find feeling like this **harder to deal** with, the excess energy, hyper mood and normality becomes too much and then I will start the old habits again go back into my shell where I feel normal.

I have normalised feeling like shit and somewhat feel safe there, its the feeling good and energetic that overwhelms me and I can deal with it. It nearly feels like self sabotage and I always reset and relapse. Also to add, that emotions, trauma and memories become way to hard to deal with when I don't have alcohol to block out.

Just wondering if anyone has experienced this or what they may have done to stay on track.

I was open and honest about my needs, and dedicated to working on our issues - nobody is perfect, but what he had was fundamentally good. I thought he was a man of his word willing to put in at least some effort. 

Two months ago he was talking about marriage. He was the one leading us to look at houses; never stopped me when I divested money for a down payment, when my parents then kindly did the same. Let me keep plans for my family to visit his, even when I realised he was under pressure and maybe it wasn’t a good idea. Let me come to spread his grandmothers ashes a week ago, even when I asked if he was sure given some recent conversations. I thought he was still in it. He’s been travelling and I thought we’d finally have a chance when he came home tonight. The home he was so keen to build. 

Instead he’s blindsided me, breaking up with me on the phone, saying we’re too “different”. He’s literally never mentioned a single issue he had with me, never given me an opportunity to evolve to meet his needs - which I would have done, happily. He says he shouldn’t have to ask. He’s just devastated a beautiful future, to see if the grass is greener elsewhere. When we hung up, he still said I love you. Who does that.

I just want oblivion now. I want to sleep for days. I want to rage. I want to abandon the house and everything in it, take off my skin and shed everything even tangentially related to him - even this country. I want to quit my job and flee, sit still in a cabin for eons until I turn to stone. I want to break all my plans, disappoint others, and cry in my fathers arms for months.

I have no problem finding a partner but fail to maintain those relationships. I have become the black sheep of my loving family. My short term memory is almost non existent and I do not remember significant portions of my life. I used to be a gifted athlete but can no longer enjoy the sport I love, whether on the court or as a spectator. I have lost the capacity to learn like I used to. I have become an angry person with a startling capacity for violence. I feel trapped in this addiction, unable to give up on the hope of realizing my full potential but unable to realize it. I am so tired. 
     I found a detox place who will take my insurance and for once I have something to look forward to. Wish me luck.",2023-03-02 08:16:43,1677745003

On one of my last binge sessions, I woke up at 3am with severe chest pain, cold sweats, and extreme fatigue. It lasted for 2 days, it scared me and led me to take myself to hospital.

Numerous blood tests and x-rays later, the doctor gave me the all clear. I was particularly worried I may have had alcoholic hepatitis, but my liver seems to have been cleared of this as well.

Anybody else experienced anything like this? I'm in two minds about this as the Ed doctor gave my liver the all clear, but at the same time I think I've had a big wakeup call!

stopdrinking,i just turned 20 but i think i’m an alcoholic,"I am a 20 year old female and I have just recently moved in with my boyfriend. I started drinking soon after we moved in together, i don’t know how it all got so bad. my boyfriend is a recovered heroine addict and has been clean for a while now. we would drink together in the beginning and things started to get out of hand. blacking out, play fighting that turns into anger, ect.he stopped drinking after a few incidents in which he accidentally chocked me until i passed out because we were play fighting, he’s yelled at me and got in my face. I’ve caught him talking to his ex multiple times and I think that’s where I started resenting him. he has apologized numerous times and hasn’t met up with her or anything so I just said i would forgive him. after that he has been the best, he has changed his life around in every way. but i’ve still been stuck in this rut, I am fine not drinking but when I do i blackout every time. I scream, cry, throw things, call him names, cut myself, ect. I loose all control and every time I drink I just think about him texting this other girl even though we have moved past it. i feel so guilty for the things i’ve done and i always so i’m going to stop drinking but never do. but this time i’m actually done. i want to make my relationship better and i will do whatever I can to stop drinking. how do i get over this guilt? he says he forgives me but i know he shouldn’t. I am taking zoloft (100mg) i’m sure that doesn’t help when i drink. he has changed so much and has been such a good person, why is it so hard for me. someone please help, i think i have been in denial about my alcohol problems and it’s hitting me like train thinking about all the horrific stuff i’ve done. i’m concerned about myself, and my relationship.",2023-03-02 06:42:53,1677739373

Walking down the aisles with liquor and wine felt like being in a haunted house. It's been awhile since I felt so ill at ease, and I just wanted to get out of there. I grabbed a bottle and practically ran towards the areas with the food samples.

stopdrinking,Deciding to quit drinking,"Well I'm one day into sobriety. In the past I could make it about 3 days in although this time I'm confident because I'm approaching it in a more clear mindset than usual. My drinking habits changed over time. At one point I was a wino (nothing fancy, just cheap boxed wine), then it was little bottles of wine occasionally but mostly cider and Mike's (usually 12 Mikes a day), on top of that also champaign. Eventually my final drinking habit (the one I'm ending my addiction with) was shots of whiskey and at least a mason jars worth of vodka (spread across 5-6 cocktails) a day. For the past few months I've been blacking out like 5 to 6 days a week. As you can imagine this has had a negative effect on my life and job. I have binge issues in general so part of my problem is when I start drinking I don't stop until I wake up. I'm making a change now. Alcohol is fun but when you can't do it in moderation it becomes a terrible thing. No more waking up on the floor. No more finally crawling out of bed for work, chugging water/Pedialyte, and popping a adderall to get going. It's a shame too because my main hobby is making videos and I've wasted so much time. Now I want to focus on my art as my hobby and focus again. It's hard though because my family is going through stressful times but I gotta remember that I wouldn't do a lot of good to my family or parents if I died this year at the age of 23. I also wouldn't be any good if I had wet brain which is a big fear of mine ever since I saw the Lady Di story on Opie and Anthony.

Not this time, I showed up for myself, tended to my health, no smoking, no drinking, and took care of my life. I feel I needed to experience some pain in order to test my ability to make changes finally in my life. After this I feel I can handle anything sober.

stopdrinking,2 months: Temptations,"For this month I wanted to share a couple reoccurring thought patterns that lead me to feel tempted, and the truth which has helped me to combat those temptations. 


tempting thought 1: ""it's been [amount of time] now since you've last drank, clearly you don't have a problem with alcohol as you are able to distance yourself from it. you can afford a drink."" 

truth: Just because I'm able to put some distance between myself and alcohol does not mean that I don't have a problem with it, or that I won't begin to abuse it once it's back in my life. 

it's also harmful to think this way, because it creates a catch 22 situation. if I succeed in removing alcohol from my life, then it's only a matter of time before I use that success as an excuse to drink again. my success becomes the reason I fail, and I remain trapped in a viscous cycle. 


tempting thought 2: ""you don't really want to stop drinking, you just want to drink less. besides... how are you going to get better at moderating drugs if you never do them?""

truth: the reality is... I would be re-introducing addictive substances into my life in order to quell some sort of insecurity within myself. but when does it end? there seems to be no finish line in sight about this way of thinking. when will I ever get to the point of convincing myself that I can moderate enough? it's never going to happen. 


tempting thought 3: ""what's the point of quitting for a year if you're just going to start drinking again? might as well drink now."" 

truth: no, that's dumb for like a billion different reasons.


These are just a couple of the thoughts that pop into my head on occasion. maybe you have experienced these temptations and maybe they have even caused you to slip up. Either way, hopefully I can provide a new perspective and some additional firepower in the fight against this addictive and terrible substance. 

Thank you for your time and I wish you continued growth moving forward 🧡🧡🧡

End feeling god awful and sick for another 2-3 days. I’ve been looking into antabuse to keep myself in check, these binge cravings usually hit like a wave late afternoon towards the weekend, and its like an hour, hour and a half between when it hits and when im obliterated. whenever i have a big compelling short term reason not to drink, I don’t, but I keep proving to myself that in the moment, the whole “to stop my life from spiraling” longterm goal isnt enough for me. I’m not really big on pills, I think ive gotten a prescription for antibiotics once and thats about the extent, so this isnt my wheelhouse. I got an e-apt with a primary care because I don’t have one, but she’d never heard of the meds and wouldnt agree to the prescription without knowing more. It was completely civil and I actually kind of like that she’s a bit anti-interventionist, but this is the one time that I feel like leaning on an Rx’d be a lifesaver, and to my knowledge this stuff, while dangerous to consume alcohol on, is completely non-habit-forming and otherwise safe. I looked into some online stuff, but it all had programs and coaches and wanted to mail me a phone breathalyzer and I really dont think I need that. That, and they’re REALLY expensive. I was hoping people had good resources to legally and responsibly obtain a scrip without shelling out large sums if money for effective e-rehab, I’m just coming out out a few days of withdrawal and I’m pretty upset because I know if I’d had this stuff I could have likely avoided this whole stupid mess of being angry, humiliated, scared, and feeling physically like I got flattened by a steamroller.

stopdrinking,all the feelings. anxiety. epiphanies. diagnoses.,"tldr; main point of this post: does anyone have any advice for these overwhelming feelings at beginning of sobriety? or how you personally dealt with them?


i'm almost a month now. i've cycled through so many feelings. interestingly enough, not one of them has been, that i don't want to be sober. i know that drinking would only delay these emotions that are toppling over me right now. when i stopped 25 days ago, i just had to hold off drinking, taking it a day at a time, to get my head together. 

i'm in an insanely helpful IOP rehab, with an amazing therapist. god sent. anyways, i did some assessments. we have an individual session on friday to go over them, but she pulled me aside after the group IOP session. she said 1) that i scored for a severe / high risk of substance abuse disorder and 2) that i scored concerningly high on anxiety symptoms on a different assessment. she suggested that i should consider getting on anti anxiety meds until i could learn better coping skills, because she fears it will drive me to drink. i said i am not scared all the time, so i don't understand this, and she told me that anxiety isn't only being fearful... it can be overwhelm / stress, manifesting as anger, irritation, etc.  really, that clicked for me. 

i got in with my psychiatrist and i'm going to take zoloft daily, which i usually take only while im PMSing &amp; it has helped even at the lowest dose. and i am upping my dose from 25 mg to 50 mg. i really hope that this can help. ever since week 3 hit i've been so fucking overwhelmed. 

i believe that this type of anxiety stems from CPTSD and potential autism. i do not dare mention the autism to many people, let alone a professional, because i feel that i appear too ""normal"" to be diagnosed. i have heard the horror stories. anyways, shocker that both of those are known for self medicating with drugs &amp; alcohol. 

for 5 years i've just pushed so many emotions off &amp; tried to only have fun &amp; be happy, with no negativity. i think i am feeling everything i tried to not feel before. everything i tried to ignore. 10/10 don't recommend. i still don't have a sponsor yet &amp; i really need one but the time will come when its meant to. i just am ready to feel stable &amp; normal.",2023-03-02 03:06:35,1677726395

Then I have to tell myself that there will always be that first moment of my hungover next day where all of the self loathing and hatred and crippling hangziety will hit like a truck and and ruin at least one full day. 

Temporary respite from life by using booze is just that, temporary. All of my problems will be right there waiting for me, and probably be much larger and more difficult to deal with. As hard as sobriety may be sometimes, I have to remember that the alternative will always be worse.

I was very anti-alcohol growing up. I refused to drink until I was 21, and even then, I rarely drank. I did not want to risk becoming like my mom. And I felt good knowing I could be a DD for my friends and make sure they got home safely.

Enter COVID-19. I - like many people - started drinking more frequently. I was laid off and stressed and going through a break-up and thought the world was falling apart. But as the pandemic progressed and things ""settled"", I kept drinking. I used to get sick if I had more than one glass of wine... now I can down an entire bottle (or more) in one night. I went from drinking once per week (or less) to drinking every single day.

I've gained 40 lbs. My mental health has suffered. My sleep has suffered. My finances have suffered. EVERYthing has suffered.

My partner of 10 years has commented on my increased drinking. He tries so hard to be gentle in how he brings it up, but I know it's impacting him, too.

I don't want to drink this much or this frequently. I wake up each morning - exhausted and miserable - with the resolve to stop drinking... but as the day progresses, all I can think about is having a glass (or two, or three...) of wine in the evening.

I've become addicted. I know that. I recently started taking Naltrexone in the hopes that it would help. And I've definitely decreased my drinking in the couple of weeks that I've been on it so far. But I can still hear that voice in the back of my mind saying things like, ""You had a rough day at work, you deserve some wine this evening.""

I feel so guilty. I hated my mom for YEARS for what she put me through as an alcoholic... and now here I am, an alcoholic. I'm a hypocrite. And a failure.

I'm not really sure what I wanted to accomplish with this post. This is the first time I've ever put any of this in writing. I admire all of you and find so much support and empathy in this community. And I'm going to keep trying, until one day, I succeed.",2023-03-02 03:00:40,1677726040

So I waited around a couple days (dumb) and got around to it today. By the time I went in it  had subsided but I was still pretty worried. Pretty brief meeting, but they said my blood work looked normal and I looked fine. My blood pressure was elevated but I have a follow up for that later this month. I don't know if this is a win or not, I still have concerns. But it does feel good to finally be doing something about my health. I'm still not gonna drink today.",2023-03-02 02:59:20,1677725960

stopdrinking,I need to stop,"Today I realised I need to stop. 

I work from home and have a habit of drinking about 12 beers a night. 

I can’t sleep without it, I can’t socialise without it. 

I live alone and work from home, so the night hits and I drink to fill the void.

Today I decided to call Frank and spoke to a lovely lady. She explained to me how much I was really drinking in comparison to a bottle of vodka and it really put it into perspective.

I’m considering going to an AA meeting tomorrow, but I’m really struggling with the idea. I’m not sure what it consists of.

I don’t particularly want to stop drinking completely, I just want to control it and drink socially.",2023-03-02 02:52:13,1677725533
stopdrinking,There is really nothing good about it," 

When I think about what made me start drinking and what makes drinking so tantalizing to me now, I find they are two ends of the same sword. At first, I thought drinking opened me up, and when I drank I turned from a reserved person to someone completely free of inhibition: I said what I thought, I expressed how I felt and I became an energetic person. Even though my mom passed away when I was 12, I didn’t mourn her until I was 18 and got drunk. When I was sober, I felt nothing but anger and self-hatred. I did my best to cover this up, but I know sometimes it slipped through the cracks. But with alcohol, it was like all the shame and guilt I ever felt was lifted from me, like I was transformed into the best version of myself (if I didn’t get too drunk, that is).

So, is alcohol a panacea, can it cure anxiety, depression, self-hatred, and anger? True, some people are able to handle a drink or two to loosen up a little and cut themselves off, some are able to have a bender on the weekend and then go to work or school on Monday and live a normal life, completely free from the grasp of alcohol. But we alcoholics, us miserable people in the know, understand there is nothing freeing about one or two drinks: it has to be more. It has to be so much that is almost obnoxious the amount of liquid you consume. “One drink is too many and a thousand is never enough,” a quote I’ve heard from members of alcoholics anonymous in my hometown, is quite apt in its message. On days I work, on days I go to school, on days I hang out with friends, I go to family dinner, on days I know I must be sober and on the rare days I find myself not wanting a drink, I still find myself walking to the same gas station, the same liquor store and buying an obscene amount of alcohol for one person.

What do I do when I drink now? Well, for starters it changed from something that helped me get along with people to something that helped me get along with myself. I started drinking alone when I was 18, and although I would continue to drink with friends and sometimes family, I never got as drunk around someone as I did alone. In terms of happiness or satisfaction, the first drink of alcohol I consume is always the best: it makes my chest feel warm, I enjoy music more, and I can watch t.v or read books without time dragging on so much. The second one is more of the same but I get hungry and I really feel the urge to smoke a cigarette. The third one is where I become useless, I lose all interest in activities beyond sitting in my computer chair and listening to depressing emo and folk music. If a friend were to ask me to hang out or talk, at the moment of my third drink, I would 100% of the time turn them down, no matter what day it is, no matter the time, not even if I wouldn’t see them again for another year, I decided alcohol was more important. It hurt to make the decision each time, but I kept doing it. On the fourth drink, I would be bedridden and to the point that not even music interested me anymore. I would spend hours like this, in silence, combing over my life with a fine-tooth comb and pinpointing miserable memories, and saying “There! There it is! The reason why I’m like this! If only I hadn’t watched my mom die; if only my dad wasn’t so hard on me; if only I didn’t get molested as a kid; if only…” The list never ended, it seemed like my alcoholism was everyone else’s fault but my own.

It became easy to pinpoint my alcoholism as the reason I never succeeded in anything in life. I was free to think that “If I weren’t an alcoholic, maybe I would have finished school by now, and been a teacher already and living the life I was supposed to lead!” It is scary to think about what my life would be like if I never drank, because drinking to me, for these past eight years, has been so ingrained in the way I process the world. If I’m sad, I drink. If I’m happy, I drink. Long day at work? I know I got a drink waiting for me at home. If there is a party, I’m getting drunk and high. A wedding? I’m getting plastered. You're leaving town Let’s hit the bar on your last night here. You’re coming home for Christmas? Let’s get a drink. It is easy to find an excuse to drink but it’s incredibly difficult to find a reason to stop. If I have the time, and the money, I can still function like an adult (although it is just barely), what is the harm in a drink? Do I have to give up something that become so much a part of me? What if I want a beer when I’m 60? It’s forty years down the line but maybe I’ll be a good drunk by then and I’ll know to stop. It’s scary to think about a dry future, one without drugs or alcohol, one without throwing up just to sober up a bit so I can drink more, one where I don’t pass out in the middle of the day just to wake up and realize it’s tomorrow and I got to get ready for work, one where I can make plans with my friends and one where I can complete school and write the book I always wanted to write. When I’m not drunk, it’s scary cause I don’t even know myself that well. I don’t know how to deal with stress without a drink, I don’t know how to handle all the pain I feel if I can’t numb myself, I don’t know how to celebrate birthdays, weddings, graduation parties if I don’t have a drink in hand.

In the past, sobriety was just a unit of time in between drinks. I could get sober for a month or two with relative pain, but with relative ease knowing eventually I would drink again. When I got sober for a summer cause my Dad threatened to kick me out, I knew it wouldn’t last. I didn’t have to get sober, I just had to hide it better. So, was it really that fun, waking up at 5:30 am every day, getting clothes on, sneaking out through my window, and heading to the gas station the buy alcohol exactly at 6 am when they open? Was it fun coming back home, finding out my dad woke up earlier than expected, and having to walk around my neighborhood until I figured he went back to bed and then sneaked back in? Was it fun, to hide a mountain of malt liquor cans, vodka bottles, and empty packs of cigarettes underneath my desk to point that room had become off-limits to friends and family? Was it fun to have four 32-gallon garbage bags full of that stuff in my closet and have nightmares involving people opening it and finding out just how bad my alcoholism is? During that time I developed a horrible chest pain that occurred at all hours of the day, and when I went to go see a doctor he told me I was in perfect health and that my chest pain was caused by anxiety. But wasn’t alcohol supposed to cure anxiety? How could drinking cause me to be anxious? I couldn’t understand it, so I started to drink more. For a while, this worked and when I got drunk the pain in my chest would go away. When I would wake up, the pain would still be there, but it was okay because I could drink to get rid of that pain. Eventually, that stopped working too, and no matter how drunk I got the pain was unbearable. I was drunk 24/7 and I could not understand why my chest hurt. I got so worried this one day, I went to the emergency room because I thought I was having a heart attack. The doctors told me I just had a panic attack and that I was dehydrated. The first time I had a panic attack in my life was when I was drunk and that terrified me.

I called my sister one night cause I had decided to go to rehab. I understood then that my drinking was out of control, but I didn’t know how to approach it other than head-on. I was in an inpatient facility for four days and was transferred to intense outpatient therapy for two months. I stayed with my sister during this time under the condition that I was sober. I wanted to get sober during this time, truthfully and honestly, I did, but there was the big hole where alcohol used to be that I had to try and fill with hobbies and school. Eventually, I ran out of books I wanted to read and shows I wanted to watch; I even got a doctor to sign me a note that let me leave school without penalty to my GPA. I was prescribed something for my alcohol withdrawal, a rather weird drug. I will not explain how to abuse it because it is not so easy to do, but I found a way to get high off it. I was prescribed so much of it per month, that was practically imperceptible that I was taking it in abundance. It felt like I came home for the first time in a long time and I wasn’t so scared. But eventually the little buzz I caught from it bored me, it wasn’t like the real thing. I found a “nootropic” drug online that is very similar to what I was prescribed except it is much more potent. I lied to my sister and said it was a new supplement I found online that helps people with alcoholism. I wish she didn’t believe me. This drug worked wonders and I felt amazing, it felt like I was drinking without any of the bad side effects. And the best thing was the people at the facility I was at didn’t test for it so there was no way for anyone to know I was high. Sobriety meant nothing really, it just meant “not alcohol” in my eyes. So was that fun, to lie to someone who, out of the goodness of their heart and love for me, wanted nothing but the best for me? I said all the lines I was supposed to, I told everyone I was on the straight and narrow and that I was keeping my nose clean, but I didn’t mean anyone of it.

When it was time to move back into my dad’s, I had no intention of staying clean. The first night I stayed sober but the second night I said fuck it and went to the same gas station I always did and bought the same amount of alcohol. I told everyone I stopped drinking and enjoyed the praise I received but eventually, I grew bored of that too. I just wanted to drink at any cost, I wanted to turn my brain off and accept that I was a failure of a human being: I was an alcoholic, a drug addict, someone who lies, cheats, and steals from the people they love. I just wanted to die. This is when I realized that alcohol transformed from something I enjoyed to a form of self-harm. It let me label myself as something bad, it let me look at myself in a bad light, and it lets me feel like shit constantly cause I felt like that was what I was.

I can say this to you now, but I don’t know different I feel. You see, I started typing this tonight cause I want to drink, really bad. I want a big, stiff drink that will just absolutely ruin my day, my week, my year, everything. I’ve been sober since the 6th of February, my mom’s birthday, and a part of me just wants to throw that away. I want to throw away all the changes I’ve decided to make in my life and just give up, and return to the bottle because that is what I know and it’s not that scary. I have been seeing a therapist recently, and she has told me that I need to learn to love myself. From an objective point of view, I agree that every person should love themselves, but it seems impossible to me because I have hated myself for a long, long time. Drinking gives me something tangible I can hate about myself and without it, I don’t know why I feel this way at all, but I do. There is not a single thing about drinking that is beneficial to me in anyway, and yet, here I am, on a Wednesday night dreaming of bottom-shelf liquor.",2023-03-02 02:50:36,1677725436
stopdrinking,Couples,"My husband and I stopped together after about 20 years each of very heavy drinking. He drank a handful of times since we stopped, and only at events. I have not drank at all.

What do you do? When he drinks or I know he has been drinking my relapse thoughts really, really kick up. 

He’s going to a concert soon and I KNOW he’ll drink. Ditto for a boys weekend coming up. I find the first more troublesome than the latter, as I wont be around him when he goes away. But for the concert he’ll probably come home smelling like booze and being dumb. Ugh. It’s such a turnoff now.

stopdrinking,"Finally have the courage to post, and I think I need it.","Hi all, 

I've been lurking and reading posts here for quite some time. This group has been so inspiring and motivational for so long and I am finally ready to put myself out there and join everyone here.

I'm 29, employed, with a girlfriend, 2 dogs and a home together and I love it all so much.  But I know I'm not bringing everything I can to the table and I want (NEED) to try harder.

I grew up in a small town, maybe 2000 people max. With not much else to do, of course everyone I knew and looked up to drank - basically everyday. My father drinks, and all of his friends do as well. I cannot remember a time from my childhood when they didn't. All good people but drinking was always a priority. Maybe they can manage and get through life like that, I can't.

I got a job at a pizza joint at 14 which eventually  ended up buying the local Tavern  (and the only one) in the town. Worked there for years through college - and I know that's where it got bad.  Customers buying me drinks, sneaking shots and just not caring. Thinking I was above it. But I wasn't.

Made it through college, spiraling the entire way. I made good grades, but never got to really enjoy. I was into fitness, running and lifting and just a happy person in general. I was still working at this bar every weekend, and prioritizing drinking instead.

It eventually caught up to me. I got a DUI at the ripe age of 21 and thought I would never drink again. I was so wrong. I made so many promises, and ""well maybe tomorrow I'll do better"" statements. 

Ended up getting a good job despite all the issues, which I still feel that I got so damn lucky and have managed to hold down for 5 years so far. Drinking every. Single. Day. For years. Smirnoff 100 proof shots. Between 6 and 10 on average.  Some days more some days less. Sometimes I can will myself to do better, most days I give in though. There are ups and downs, but I know I will never give up.

I love running, I love trying new hobbies, I love exploring the world and having fun with my girlfriend and soon to be fiance, I love being energetic for my dogs and I really want to continue and grow as a person.

I am sick of the anxiety, the stress, feeling like the world is crumbling everyday for absolutely basic things. Dreading getting out of bed in the morning. Doing chores, seeing friends and family. Feels like going through life on hard mode everyday. 

Overall, I know I need a change and I know I can do it, and become a better person and who I am supposed to be. But I need to admit that I need help, I have tried to do it alone and I'm realizing that is not the way for me. 

Following this community has made such an impact and has helped me stay positive and keep trying. I will never stop trying. Thank you all for being so inspiring.

I was a daily IPA and whisky drinker, anywhere from 2-6 drinks a day but enjoyed silly expensive stuff.

Since then I've bought some new fun gear to pursue my true passion for being outdoors. New kayaks and a new mountain bike specifically. These are hobbies that are infinitely more healthy and enjoyable than wasting time recovering from hangovers

stopdrinking,Day 45 personal observations and questions,"Today is day 45 for me! I have a couple of observations that I wanted to share/ask about.

I've had several dreams now about alcohol. In the dream, I'm at a social event and someone is trying to get me to drink and I cave. As they are making the drink or getting it for me, I start thinking about how I don't want to drink and how disappointed I'll be in myself in just a moment when I drink. Does anyone else have these type of dreams ?

The second thing I've observed, is feeling more childlike if that makes sense. I feel like I'm doing things the kid version of me would have wanted. I am enjoying playing simple games on the Ps5 that make me happy, I'm seeking out learning more about different animals that I find interesting, I'm allowing myself to get excited to go out for an ice cream, and when I find something cute for my home I buy it without thinking of if it ""perfectly fits."" All of this is recent with my recent decision to quit alcohol. I do enjoy feeling this way, but I'm curious as to why this connects with me giving up alcohol.

stopdrinking,Day 1. Hard to find motivation,"Before Covid, I never would have considered that I had a problem.  However, since midway through 2020, I have had about 3-5 drinks almost every single night.  Oftentimes more, rarely less.  On days off, I often rot in bed while wasted, just because I don’t feel like existing.

Other than some weight gain, I haven’t experienced many large “consequences”.  Sure, money, some mornings I feel nauseous.  No relationships ruined, no jobs lost.  

I know this isn’t sustainable.  I don’t want to wait until I hit “bottom”.  But because I don’t have any kids, or a partner, or really anyone hurt by my drinking, it’s so easy to just tell myself “okay, one more night”",2023-03-01 23:12:17,1677712337

stopdrinking,Why are the voices so loud??,"Hey y’all! I really debated about posting this because I don’t want to sound crazy lol. I was sober for 90 days and relapsed about a month ago. I’ve now been sober for 33 days. Over the past 2 weeks I’ve had really intense periods of disassociating episodes. Feelings of intense emotions, being outside my body, losing track of time, forgetting where I am and what I was doing, unable to focus or concentrate, memory loss, severe fatigue and lethargy, detachment from my surroundings, and the list goes on. Has anybody experienced these episodes after getting sober?? My brain is telling me to drink so I can escape and drown out all of these thoughts. I do have a psychiatrist and team of therapists and they are aware of what’s going on. They think I’m manic, but I’ve also never had these episodes prior to becoming sober. I’m starting to see a correlation between what’s happening to me and my sobriety. Please tell me I’m not losing my mind. I feel so alone in this.

In 6 months I was thinking of saying that I have a year of sobriety. I know it’s a personal choice how I tell my story. If anyone has any input. It won’t hurt my feelings if it’s said that’s not “right”. 
I could say I have a year total minus 2 weeks. 
I’m sure it may sound silly but it feels weird to say I have 2 weeks sober because I still have most of the good things I’ve gained in the last 6 months. I am not in the place that I was the first time I was at 13 days…

What I did realize is that, had I gone with them and planned not to drink, I’m not sure I would have been strong enough. Now I am realizing my boundaries, at least for now. I will need to develop strategies for my upcoming social commitments where people will be drinking.

I struggled to make it a few days without - and when I did I was uncomfortable, unable to sleep, grouchy, irritable, felt like shit, etc.. but never had the type of withdrawal that some speak of (requiring hospitalization and so forth).

stopdrinking,10 years of drinking every night. Starting to experience weird cognitive symptoms. Looking for anyone’s testimony to this.,"TLDR: been drinking 6-7 shots of vodka a night, every night, for 10 years. Starting to experience memory and cognitive malfunction. Anyone else experience this?

I didn’t start drinking until 31. Not a drop. I had always been a night owl (borderline insomniac) and discovered that wine made me sleepy and would help me maintain a typical sleeping regimen. But the more I leaned on wine, the sicker I felt each morning. So I upped it to vodka. Usually 4 shots a night after I came home from work. This made a big difference in how I felt in the morning. 

So this became my routine. Every. Day. And I have not stopped since. Now I am up to 6 or 7 shots a night (never more and very rarely less). Usually, I will space it out over a couple of hours until I get sleepy and head to bed. 

I am 41 now. Married. Two kids (6month old and a 3 year old). I don’t hide my drinking but I don’t broadcast it. I work an incredibly stressful job and being relatively new to the struggles of parenthood has me in and out of mild/moderate depression. 

I am not overweight, however I am not active. I vape now, too. And I have come to realize that likely started as a result of not being able to drink during the day. Yet, I am well hydrated and take an assortment of vitamins and supplements daily. 

I share all this bc I am experiencing symptoms from what I assume to be years of alcohol abuse. Until this year, I had never observed these hindrances (random memory challenges….or temporary memory loss. Like not being able to remember names of people, events, or things I said). Once prompted or reminded, my mind will register the connection and my memory will “restore”. Kinda like how you may forget that you saw a movie a long time ago and start to watch it again and realize all of a sudden you’ve already seen it. 

This is happening with greater regularity. It is accompanied with brain fog which affects my ability to read as quickly as I am accustomed. It’s like my eyes are moving faster than my brain can keep up. Same with typing. 

Oh yeah…..and I have practically no libido. This is a new symptom, as well. There could be some emotional trauma that is supplementing this but there is no doubt in my mind the alcohol is the main culprit. I recently had my testosterone checked and it is indeed low. 

There is no doubt I have an addiction. And I am working on that currently. But part of me wonders if my current sleep deprivation (bc of new baby) is contributing. 

I wanted to post this here to see if anyone else has experienced this and whether or not it improved after the cessation of drinking.",2023-03-01 20:55:36,1677704136

stopdrinking,2 years today,"Title says it. Two years of not drinking today. In the last two years I have greatly improved my mental and physical health.

I'm sleeping better, I'm not bloated all the time, and overall I just don't feel like shit in the ways I used to. I'm figuring out what I want to do as a career (currently trying to break into tech sales), and my overall life has just improved tremendously. 

I've been working out with a personal trainer for the last year, and consciously trying to eat better over the last 5 months. I wouldn't have been able to do these things had I continued drinking. 

Just a milestone I wanted to share in case anyone is struggling. The first weeks and month were challenging, but I knew that things would get better. I still get cravings, and when I see people drinking alcohol there's a voice inside me that goes ""mmm, that would be nice"" but I know it's wrong. 

At my job one of our customers dropped off a thank you present of sees candy. My coworkers don't eat sugar, and I'm a sugar fiend... So I pretty much ate the whole box over the course of a week. One of the candies was some form of chocolate liquor and at first it was disgusting, and then I was like ""hmm. Not bad..."" But it didn't really cause any issues other than the momentary ""is this worth it to start again?"" Followed by a clear ""no. It is not"".

Many things are improving except the exhaustion.

My kid was running around playing, I was doing dishes and such, and our birds were tweeting as loud as they could. There was no way. Lol. But I have to say I was incredibly turned off by this meeting. It was much too heavy with religion for me and I just didn’t feel like I could jive with the group. I’ve been to AA before when I was younger so I know that I should just keep searching for one I’m comfortable with. I’m not sure I want to totally do AA but I think it’s worth a try to see. Plus it’s local and maybe I can find a buddy or something. If anyone is familiar with these - do you have any idea how the call in (not zoom) meetings work? Can I keep it muted? I am entirely unable to keep my house silent or get solitude. Also, do you get chips from the online meetings? It is literally impossible to get to one in person unfortunately. At least for a while.

Music sounds better, I can face my emotions, I'm more chatty and I'm also a very friendly and caring drunk which endears me to other people. However I know its terrible for me long term and I always feel depressed and unmotivated the next day 

I guess I'm posting this for a bit of support to help me through this evening, if I can get through tonight and enjoy my day tomorrow I might begin down a road of good habits! 

I've fallen victim to this bad habit too many times, going on 13 years now. 

Thanks in advance for the support!",2023-03-01 18:23:07,1677694987
stopdrinking,Gut health question..,"So, when did diarrhea get better for everyone?

stopdrinking,100 days,"When I started, I had no idea how I would get here. I just knew I needed to stop, and stop right then and there. So I focused on that day, and then the next, and the next, until, with help, my feet were under me and life felt like some sort of normal. 

Now, I’m less of a person staying sober day to day and more a person who doesn’t drink; that’s just part of my identity. I still have all the tools I learned  but I don’t need to call on them nearly as often.

Anyway, given that I made it this far I thought I’d share some things that worked for me. PLEASE keep in mind these are just my things and what worked for me might not work for you. Still, I’m so so grateful these things worked for me:

- THIS SUB. I started out checking in every single day, and the promise to not drink that day kept me going for the day. I don’t do that as regularly now, but in the beginning the feeling of accountability and community was key.

- SMARTRECOVERY. I’m lucky enough to live in a big city with a SMART meeting nearby, and it was a huge help. I never tried AA (their philosophy doesn’t appeal to me) but I did all the worksheets on the SMART website and attended a meeting a week. Again, the feeling of being part of a community that was sharing experiences and keeping each other gently accountable was key. I don’t go every week anymore, but I’m glad it’s there when I need it.

- NA BEERS AND MOCKTAILS. So once I tackled the physical cravings and the awkwardness of being in a social situation without drinking, I still had one hurdle to figure out: I really really like the taste of alcohol. It’s delicious! Luckily I’ve found a number of NA beer options I really enjoy, and mocktails have gotten SO much better than the glasses of sugar they used to be. I recommend the bottled product Phony Negroni from St. Agrestis - tastes just like a regular Negroni. 

CANNABIS - Obviously, this is a big YMMV for this one, but for me this helped a ton with cravings initially.

Anyway, that’s about it. There were other small things I can share in the comments if anyone is curious but those were the big four. I hope this helps! The main things I would ask new sobernauts to keep in mind are 1) it does get easier, 2) you CANNOT do it alone without a plan, and 3) no one else gets to tell you what the plan should be. Make a plan, take it a day at a time, and IWNDWYT!!!",2023-03-01 18:14:08,1677694448
stopdrinking,I’m a binge drinker who was in denial,"Hi guys, I’m currently on day 4 (again). I went to rehab in 2017 because I was physically addicted to street fentanyl. I started doing it when I was drunk. I did any drug that was out in front of me when I was drunk. I called myself a heroin addict all throughout rehab. And after the fact. Truth is I should’ve stopped drinking in high school. I was a clear alcoholic in high school but the party lifestyle has tons of addicts in denial so I just kept going. 

I stayed sober for 4 years.

Here’s the truth. I was never a heroin addict. I was a pure alcoholic who made the most self destructive choices because I would be WASTED out of my mind. In April of 2021 I started drinking again because I told myself I could moderate. I would scour the internet for articles of addicts who drink again successfully to make myself feel better. 

This has been the hardest 2 years of my life.

They say alcoholism is a progressive disease, and I feel like mine kept progressing even while sober. I go months at a time not drinking after having something terrible happen while blacked out. I cannot have just one. I am powerless over alcohol. I black out nearly every single time I drink, going into the night telling myself just a few. 

I turn into a complete opposite person while drunk. A complete personality change. It’s very scary.

It hurts to admit. I’m only 29 and bitter I can’t be ‘normal’. I can’t go to the bar with my friends and have a chill night. Well I can but I have to literally sit there and think about not drinking too much the entire time. Then the next time I get wasted cuz I pay myself on the back for a good nights drinking then blackout the next time. It’s time to realize normal is different for everybody. If I don’t want to die, my normal has to be not drinking. 

So I’m here today. Lucky I’m not dead, didn’t lose my job, didn’t lose any friends. What I did do is get kicked out of bars, try to fight bartenders, make my family cry.

But what I still sit with is all the guilt, shame, embarrassment, and regret from these two years of trying to moderate. I know if I want to stop adding more to these feelings, I cannot drink again. 

Had to get some stuff off my chest. Thanks for listening.",2023-03-01 18:12:01,1677694321
stopdrinking,Starting my Journey,"First of all, let me make it clear that I am not deciding to quit because of some tragic event or medical related experience. However, I have made the decision that I want to attempt to avoid alcohol.

My family, both Mother and Father, have members who suffer from Alcoholism, with depression prevalent on my Fathers side of the family. On a visit with my Brother, whom I am not terribly close with but am friendly with, I learned that he had very telling signs of Liver failure (Jaundice, Bloated Abdomen, Excessive Weight Gain, Shakes from recent withdrawal). He has been in rehab seeking help and I am proud of him for that. But it got me thinking about my own drinking habits. I had stints of cold turkey quitting to prove to myself that I wasn't addicted and could stop if I wanted to. However, each time I would resume drinking it would be a little more than before. It got to a point to where I was drinking basically 3-4 16oz beers, or multiple IPAs every day. 

Then, after mid January, I decided that I needed to give my Liver a break (I had a recent panel performed due to a weird medical issue that passed, but it had me concerned and I found that my panels were all in the green and good). During this time I found that I would often have extra time where I would suffer from the Habit withdraw (not knowing what to do because I made it a subconscious habit to drink when playing video games or when my In-Law would babysit my wife and I's kid for the night). 

About a week ago, I had started toying with the idea that I just stop drinking. I notice that I still have some yearning to drink. I believe that is because I did have enjoyment drinking and letting loose, as well as enjoying the taste of alcohol. However, I wonder if there was some kind of subconscious coping that I was driving me to drink, be it depression or boredom.

I spoke to my mother about my decision, and she was proud. My father was an alcoholic which was ultimately why she left him before he died. I also found that my Grandfather had health related issues which were very likely exaggerated by drinking (heart failure). Then I found out that my Uncle decided to stop drinking himself around my age because he found himself walking through a snowstorm in order to buy a 6 pack and he didn't like the feeling of loss of control.

All of this long post leads me to the decision I told my family about last night, that I wanted to try and stay Sober. Again, this is not a medically necessary reason, nor is it really driven out of mental health concerns (PTSD from my deployment was managed about a year ago which almost ended my marriage). My wife of 10 years, fully supports my decision and thinks this is for the best as well. I already feel like I am having better sleep, and I don't feel guilty for eating sweets or that I have to run more than 8 miles a day to fend off the ""beer gut"". 

So I am looking for communities to help keep my motivation up, and remind myself that this decision was made for positive, hopeful reasons. I hope that you guys can welcome me.",2023-03-01 18:11:26,1677694286
stopdrinking,Daughter was born this morning and tomorrow I have 6 months of sobriety,"My wife gave birth after a traumatic 36 hours of labor… and guess what? I was able to be there for her like I promised I always would be. Got to suffer along with her and do it sober.

When my daughter was born I had a flood of emotions come over me the first time I got to hold her. I got sober 6 months ago for her and my wife. I made a promise to myself that I would clean up my act and really give life everything I have in order to be a role model for my kid. I’ve been having thoughts of relapse recently but I’ve held out strong knowing that I’ll never be able to successfully moderate.

My Dad also died in this Hospital 10 years ago so it was an overwhelming feeling knowing my first child was born not far from where I last saw him. Dad had 33 years of sobriety when he passed away, and I hope he’s looking down at me today proud of the man I’m becoming.",2023-03-01 18:11:20,1677694280

- The random body pains that are unrelated to the gym. Even when I was going daily, i'm sure I was only doing 20% of I was truly capable of. But hurting like I was training for a marathon.

- Sleep sweats. Changing pillows in the middle of the night because its wet and cold. 

- Getting road rage over the dumbest stuff. Not major road rage, thank god but still embarrassing that I ever got so angry in public. 

- Nausea after my morning coffee, every, single, morning. Even if I drank water first.

- Texting random contacts on my phone who I haven't spoken to in ages. Top tier cringe, and I'll never do it again.

- Family and friends looking at my face and asking ""Whats wrong with your eyes?"" ""Did you not sleep yesterday""?

- Gym trainer asking if I checked my weight when I was supposed to and me holding my head down saying ""I forgot, i'll check tomorrow"".

stopdrinking,Will my marriage survive sobriety?,"I've been struggling to moderate / control my drinking for the past several years. I'm an owner of two small but successful businesses, have a wonderful network of friends and family, and by all accounts would consider myself successful in life. Except when it comes to my unhealthy relationship with alcohol. Looking back on my earliest drinking days, I probably always had an issue with acceleration and breaking, especially when I began dabbling with other substances late in HS and college.   


By my late 20's to early 30's, I'd left all the other substances behind but held onto alcohol as my go-to for celebrations, nightly stress relief and general stress anesthetist. My nightly drinking routine increased with every new level of success (and stress) in personal income and business. Maybe 5 years ago, I started cycles of excessive drinking where once every 2-3 months I'd have a really stressful crunch at work and go 3-4 drinks too many, resulting in mild blackouts and lapses in judgement. The pattern has followed and increased in regularity over the past few years as covid created both extreme challenges and exciting new opportunities for me in business.   


Now, my wife is exhausted from it all, and isn't sure she wants to continue in our marriage. She has little faith that I can be truly happy without alcohol, that my need to avoid triggering situations (of which there are plenty) will prevent us from living a fulfilled life together. She's also worried about the persistent impact on our two teenage daughters.   


In my heart, we're better together as a family, but I don't want to hold my wife, the mother of my beautiful girls and my best friend in the universe, from being happy herself.   


Appreciate anyone whose lived this story and made it out happily married on the other side...",2023-03-01 17:59:32,1677693572
stopdrinking,Really worried about Polyneuropathy,"Ive been having this burning feeling that moves around over my body since this Sunday. I had been drinking quite a lot on friday and had a pretty bad hangover. Of course i started googling and found out about this. My question is, can it really be polyneuropathy? Does it move around or stay in for example my feet? 
 Im 33, ive never been dependent on alcohol and usually only drink one day a week or even less. This week though i got drunk both on Wednesday and Friday (got the week of).
 This ""burning"" (not painful but annoying) feeling is worst in my hands and feet (not usually at the same time) but it kinda moves around all over my body and sometimes i barely feel it at all. I also read it could be a sign of anxiety.

stopdrinking,75 hard,"Has anyone else used 75 hard program to kick off quitting alcohol? For the last 2 years I’ve known that my relationship with alcohol was just getting worse. I couldn’t go more than 3 days without a drink and then it was always at least 3 drinks. The hangovers were getting worse. I was spending more on alcohol than ever before, and my productivity was shit. In September I made it 21 days but went right back to my routine through the holidays. On January 6th I started 75 hard (2- 45 min workouts- one outside, no alcohol, follow a diet, drink a gallon of water, read 10 pages of a nonfiction book, etc. for 75 days). I’m on day 55 and feel an honest change with my feelings towards alcohol. The true test was visiting my family last week. Not only did I not drink, but my family barely drank either.

stopdrinking,Dealing with a drunk guy,"So God knows I turned up to conference calls for work after/during/while drinking more than once, got called out on it, and it did me zero favors and a lot of problems and dead ends. I didn't end up getting sacked, but could've easily, and it nevertheless severely limited what I was able to do there. Eventually sobered up, got my shit mostly together and moved on to another place where I am doing well and made a clean start. (As an aside, the company was incredibly supportive while I was getting straightened out, gave me time off, and kept my seat warm. I left as much because I needed a change of scenery and to break some bad habits and relationships that weren't helpful.)

Fast forward quite a bit: for the past half-year or so, I have been dealing with a guy entirely over the phone, usually 1-3 calls a week during the afternoon or mornigns, and I can always tell when he is/was drinking, which seems to be often if not exactly all the time. It's really awful. His speech is often slurry and unclear; he doesn't make much sense; and he'll forget what we discussed on subsequent calls. He is self-employed and there is always potential in his projects, but in the end, they get screwed-up somehow.  We did one and only one video call and he looked like shit, so I understood then why he opted just for phone calls.

**And I'm like ...FUCK!... I was that guy. So dreadful to think back.**

Anyway, these conversations create in me a sense of enormous gratitude for the people that both put up with me at my worst, and also pushed me to get better; but they also create a really ugly feeling that falls somewhere between scorn and derision and pity for this poor soul. I wish it didn't, but it does, and I am trying to understand why. Something about looking in old mirrors perhaps.

I have thought about asking him directly if he's been drinking? But we've never met in person, we're not colleagues or friends, and I just doubt there is any way to really constructively address it. But maybe I am wrong, maybe I should just be, ""I am really sorry, but I have to ask, have you been drinking, because it seems like you're not 100% with us right now.""

And also, the deals he brings just end up a waste of time even when good on paper, so unfortunately, I also need to scale back involvement in terms of managing my own time and resources at a new place. So from that purely business standpoint, I also need to manage how this could all backfire.

tl;dr: dealing with a Drunk Guy on work calls is depressing and creates a lot of mixed emotions because it reminds when I was the Drunk Guy.",2023-03-01 17:20:44,1677691244

Also - I know it's probably easier when you're just at the bar getting a drink for yourself, but if you're at a table w/ a lot of people, I'd love to know how you guys handle it w/out making it totally obvious.",2023-03-01 16:03:30,1677686610
stopdrinking,my boy Gus,"A little over five years ago, one of my cats, Gus, died. He had a progressive intestinal blockage from a growing tumor, and he'd been losing weight for a few months.

When he got diagnosed, I felt guilty because I had noticed his weight loss a few months earlier -- but I was distracted, and I didn't do anything about it. Not even sure if I could have done anything to help him, at any point -- but he was definitely too far gone by the time I got him to the vet. In early February, he finally stopped eating completely, and fatty liver started a few days later. I called a home vet service, and my girlfriend stayed with me while he was euthanized at home, sleeping in my lap while he passed.

That night, after the vet tech has taken him away, I poured myself a pint glass of wine, and started drinking. A few sips in, I suddenly felt intensely more guilty and shitty for drinking to numb the grief... It was like, after failing to keep him from dying, didn't I owe my sweet little guy at least to accept the grief, instead of running and hiding from it? To skip it felt like adding insult to injury.

I put the wine glass down, and realized that I'd been drinking 3-4 glass of wine, every night, for at least the last few months. I'd developed the habit slowly over several years, creeping into a place where I really needed that warm content feeling every evening.

A few years earlier, a therapist had advised me to ""lean into it"" when I was grieving a loss. So I poured out the wine, and say back down, and just let the grief run through me. It was terrifying, and I felt all kinds of shit that I definitely had not wanted to feel. I spent a while thinking about my own life, and whether anyone would really mourn me... I'd been going through a rough patch with my girlfriend at the holidays, and I felt like such a giant piece of shit. And I knew that being drunk Every. Single. Night. was definitely making things worse, not better.

I cried myself to sleep that night... But the next three nights, I don't remember sleeping at all -- I was exhausted, but I'd become so dependent on alcohol to sleep that my body had forgetten how to relax itself.

I bought some CBD edibles, and sleep did come back... It wasn't nearly the same as being drunk. I still really missed that warm feeling from the wine, but I did manage to sleep, and not get fired from my job.

For a few weeks, I wasn't really sure what I was trying to do, in the long term... I had a few nights where I drank again -- but every time I did I, I just felt all that guilt coming back, and the realization of just how much I'd let myself turn into an asshole. I missed Gus so much -- he'd trusted me, and relied on me for everything, and look where that got him.

I started going to some meetings, but I didn't say anything. It just felt so dumb to be talking about my dumb cat to people who were losing spouses, kids, jobs, homes... I mean, I HAD lost all of that shit, but it'd been in slow motion of several years, and I'd managed to avoid blaming the booze. So none of it felt quite so pointed as my dead cat, at first.

By the middle of February, I had started to cut back on the edibles. I think my last alcoholic drink was around Feb 20th -- and then a few days later I ran out of edibles, and just decided not to buy anymore. And then that was it. I didn't start counting for a few months, I was so scared I wouldn't be able to sustain it.

At some point in there, I started realizing just how much I had been avoiding feeling anything, for such a long time. The BIG stuff, like the marriage and jobs and friendships I'd lost, started coming into the foreground. But I just kind of LET it come, and I dealt with it, and felt sad and shitty and angry -- and I didn't drink or smoke or eat anything. And then the feelings passed, and I started realizing: It's not gonna kill me, is it?

It took me a long time to start talking about myself at meetings, and even longer to start doing the actual program. I had a lot of growing up to do, and I'd been stunting my emotional growth for so long.

But it was the best goddamn decision I ever made in my entire life. Five years later, I can honestly say that I have started to trust myself. I have two wonderful cats, and I take goddamn good care of them... And I'm working on taking better care of myself, too. I'm not perfect -- but I KNOW I'm not a piece of shit. I have a place in this universe, and it's a pretty good one.",2023-03-01 16:00:47,1677686447
stopdrinking,10 days in Punta Cana,"Hey sober fam,

Got back last weekend from my first sober vacation in Dominican Republic.

And me oh my - it was awesome!

Abundant energy, clarity of mind, restful sleep - just to name a few of the benefits.

Around mid morning each day I ran up and down the beach in the sunlight - about 9 glistening kilometers in total.  The little fitness center they had was perfect, too.

The food was incredible.  I stuck to mostly plants and was able to basically eat as much as I want and didn't gain a single ounce of 'vacation weight' (no useless calories from alcohol and the small amount of sugary desserts I consumed were destroyed by the daily physical exertions).

A big highlight: I hit 100 days alcohol-free on the same day that I went zip-lining over the rainforest with my daughter - and that was really special.  Soaring over the lush canopy like a bird, with full presence of mind, with my family, straight as an arrow - and happier than a pig in shit lol.

Sobriety is the greatest gift I have ever given to myself.

Thank you all for your help and support in getting me here!

stopdrinking,Another benefit of not drinking,"My most noticeable physical benefit from not drinking is the absence of THROBBING hangover headaches. But, after having a little heartburn just now that subsided after about 10 minutes sitting down, I was reminded about the heartburn that felt like someone shoving a white-hot knife up to my throat from under my sternum that I would occasionally get after a heavy night of drinking...

stopdrinking,Weight loss problems?,"Hello Sobernauts, 

It’s been about 3 weeks since my last drink, prior to that I had cut down significantly to start the new year. I’m down almost 10 pounds to start the new year, as a large portion of my calories were coming almost exclusively for beer. 

Normally this would be good thing but I’m very slight to begin with. I’ve been eating 3 solid meals per day as well as 2 protein shakes and the occasional snack. Also have been in the gym 5 times a week. I just can’t seem to get any weight back. 

Has anyone else experienced this sort of thing? Would really appreciate healthy ways to put on weight.",2023-03-01 15:28:32,1677684512
stopdrinking,Does anyone follow a similar pattern?,"I'll be alcohol free for a while, usually taking Naltrexone though I'll get to a point where I feel like I am doing good and don't need it. Or I think I can drink a day or two a week. When I drink, it's not even much, with three beers being enough for me. That leads me to a ""break from sobriety"" which always leads me to the same place. 

I progressively feel my energy level tapering off. I have a lot of days off, since I work 12 hour shifts. I feel tired and weary. I'll have an afternoon beer due to boredom. Then a couple in the evening. I start feeling depressed and irritable. I fall behind on goals and chores. I start thinking I look a little washed up. Nothing I liked before is interesting to me and I can't even find music I want to listen to or something I want to watch or read. I feel hopeless. I then hit a wall, and I realize I need to be sober again. I go back on Naltrexone. And for the first day or so, I feel so flat and miserable. 

I am so tired of this cycle and I wonder if anyone else has a similar experience. Just struggling right now.",2023-03-01 15:23:49,1677684229
stopdrinking,I’m trying to cut back,"I’m a 30 year old male and I was able to drink a handle of vodka over a span of 3 days. I have been trying to change what I drink and cut back. 

Now, I can drink 6-7 8% alc seltzers before I feel satisfied with my level of drunkenness. I know that isn’t great so I’d like to cut back more. I’m thinking of dropping down to 4% drinks because I think that would be easier than reducing the number of drinks off the bat. 

I’m constantly paranoid and anxious about my health and the long term effects of drinking like this, but sometimes I think I could be worse. What real dangers am I in from drinking like this? When I talk to my doctor about it he’s like cut it all out, it’s all bad, and I get that but people still drink socially all the time.

stopdrinking,Back on day one,"Last night I threw away the longest stretch of sobriety I’ve ever had. I was almost at 4 months but now I’m back to square one. I logically knew I shouldn’t have picked up that first drink and that I should reach out to someone instead but my stupid brain got so loud telling me that I could have just one and I gave in. Proceeded to drink for the entire night, woke up this morning feeling like shit. I’m just so ashamed of myself and I don’t ever want to feel like this again.

stopdrinking,Has Anybody Else Had Rapid Weight Loss?,"I've been sober for a bit over a month and curious about the experience of others with rapid weight loss early on in sobriety. 

I only started tracking my weight 15 days ago but have dropped 10lbs in that time alone. Which is, frankly, pretty extreme for a woman in that time frame. (I'm 34F, tall)

I've noticed that I have a massively decreased appetite since quitting, and rarely feel hunger. Two small meals a day is feeling like a push right now. I'm obviously eating generally healthy and have no sugar cravings, so no candy/sweets. Beyond dropping the alcohol, there's no gym. I'm only walking a few times a week, and 30mins of yoga maybe 4-5x per week.


Has anyone else, particularly women, seen this happen?

I drank, and just like I see in real life here, I immediately regretted it. Just wanted to share this dream with you, that even drinking in sleeping is not an experience that's worth it.

stopdrinking,How to feel when you feel like you’re not doing enough,"I’ve been working on sobriety for about 14 months now on and off and I notice that when I start hitting my stride around like 40 or so days, my mind starts to feel very weird. 

Along with sobriety, I’ve made huge changed in my life like starting a new job, losing 30 lbs, waking up to gym at 5am, reading a ton of books, etc. The person I was 14 months ago would be very proud and pleased of the person I am today, despite some set backs. 

But whenever I get to around 40 days…I just start to feel tired? Like all the changes I’ve made are hard to keep up and I just want to let myself have a day of doing nothing like I used to when I drank all the time. But now if that happens I feel really guilty and don’t really even feel like myself. It almost feels like I have imposter syndrome being sober and doing all this better things for myself. 

And I was just wondering if anyone else has felt that way and what they’ve found that might help with feeling that way.",2023-03-01 15:02:07,1677682927
stopdrinking,Loneliness as a trigger,"I've realized that loneliness is a trigger for me. I live alone and don't have a significant other or kids. I don't have as many close friends as I'd like. I've had an immense amount of loss and pain in the last few years and am just now processing it. 

My mom had stayed with me for two weeks and neither of us drank. I was happy to have someone around to end the day with, go on a walk with. When she left I could see it happening. It did. I made it over a week, until Monday night of all nights. I had a couple of beers, called a couple of people (which I never want to do if not drinking), and ended up going out alone. This is a regular occurrence for me. Just to feel a connection. 

I'm so tired of repeating my patterns. I'm afraid I'll never get out. I can't imagine a future or get excited. I've been diagnosed with a disease that will ultimately kill me, and make me lose my mind and functioning prior. I'm not sure when this will start. It could be tomorrow or it could be 10 years. I guess I mention this because no matter if I'm physically alone or with others, this is always hanging over me and makes me feel alone.

stopdrinking,Day 1 - sick day,"I drank a lot of wine last night. My tolerance is pretty low because I recently didn’t drink for a month as part of a diet I was doing — I really enjoyed how clear my head felt and how much better I felt, and in hindsight should have just kept that up instead of testing the waters. It’s been about a week and I’ve not felt well every time I’ve drunk during this week. Last night I just kind of…kept pouring more wine. Once I start drinking I have next to no impulse control. It was bad enough that I didn’t manage to sleep more than maybe an hour nap. Now since 2 or 3am I’m shaky and so nauseous and have a headache. I’m going to make a trek to the store for some sports drinks and have a sick day sipping on electrolytes and broth and listening to audiobooks or something. I feel miserable and I don’t want to do this to myself again — not sure for how long, but for at least a good while I’m just not going to start drinking in the first place.

I am really working on getting more than 1 sober day in a row right now.  Stupid me used to drink hard seltzer first thing in the morning.  Now when I wake... I want a seltzer.  So my first urges are literally when I wake up!  

So, I drink water and eat fruit and it passes... but damn it is hard to go for water and not a seltzer.  There is none in my home now and I have asked my husband not to buy any.  

Throughout the day I get seized with urges and my soft brain can easily be manipulated.  This week I asked my husband to do all the grocery shopping bc in Florida, they sell wine and beer in grocery stores.  Yes, I cave every time I am in grocery store.  Hubby is my hero and is willing to do all the groceries.

I cannot just sit at home and shield myself from temptation.  There have been times I wished I could just read some inspiration, etc.  and not go buy beer.  I have tried a few phone apps, but they don't seem to address the immediate urge to buy beer.
